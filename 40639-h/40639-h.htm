<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The Publisher being desirous to present the American
public with a correct edition of the "<span class="smcap">Gentle Shepherd</span>,"
considerable pains have been taken to ascertain the best or
standard text. Fortunately, there were, within reach, several
of the best editions, as well as others of inferior character.
A careful examination of these satisfied us, that, the
subscription edition in quarto, printed for the Author by
Thomas Ruddiman, in 1728, has higher claims to be considered
the standard one, than any other within our knowledge.</p>

<p>For this conclusion, perhaps it might be a sufficient reason
to state, that, it was so considered by Andrew Foulis, of
Glasgow, who reprinted it in David Allan's celebrated quarto
of 1788, undoubtedly the most sumptuous edition of the
"<span class="smcap">Gentle Shepherd</span>" ever published.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> From the well-known
intelligence and proverbial accuracy of the Foulis',
and from the fact that the same house reprinted the 10th
edition of the Pastoral in 1750, (about eight years before the
Author's death,) there can be very little doubt that Andrew
Foulis possessed both the means and the inclination to ascertain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
which was the genuine text, and did so accordingly.
But, besides this, the publishers of the octavo of 1798, who
seem to have taken unusual pains to give a correct text, have
adopted the same edition as the standard, and have given a
reprint, still more literal than that of Foulis. Moreover, the
same text has been selected for the very elaborate edition of
1808, in two volumes, royal octavo; as well as for the royal
quarto, printed by Ballantyne in the same year. It is true
the orthography of both these editions of 1808 is altered; that
of the octavo being considerably Anglicised; while that of the
quarto is changed throughout to the mode of spelling adopted
by Burns. The verbal changes, however, are very few.</p>

<p>
The text of the editions of 1761, 1800, and 1850, differs, in
several places, from that of the editions before-mentioned. A
list of the principal variations, with some further remarks,
will be found in the Notes to the present edition. We have
searched diligently for an explanation of the origin of these
variations, but without success. They may belong either to
the first edition, or, to some one subsequent to 1728. But,
be this as it may, we cannot look upon them as improvements.
</p>
<p>
Neither have we been able to see any warrant for changes
in orthography, such as those we have alluded to: we have
rather supposed that readers generally, and especially the
admirers of Ramsay, would prefer to see his best poem in
precisely the same dress in which he ushered it into the
world when his poetical powers were in their prime.
</p>
<p>
In accordance with these views, we have adopted, as the
standard text, the quarto of 1728; of which the present
edition is nearly a literal reprint. Some obvious typographical
errors we have corrected, and a very few changes in
orthography have been made; all of which, with one exception,
are authorized by the editions of 1788 and 1798. Some what
greater liberties have been taken with the punctuation,
but in this also, we have been guided by the same editions,
with the aid of the octavo of 1808.
</p>
<p>
Of the "<span class="smcap">Songs</span>," the 9th, 11th, and 21st, with the verse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
at page 57, are the only ones that appear in the quarto of
1728, or in the preceding editions: the remaining eighteen
were added, probably, in 1729. In Foulis' edition of 1788,
these additional songs are excluded from the body of the
poem; but are given, with the music, at the end. Every
other edition, that we have seen, contains the whole twenty-one
songs inserted in their proper places, as in the present
edition. Another song (of which the last verse occurs at
page 57) was added subsequently, probably after 1750, for
it is not to be found among the other songs belonging to the
"<span class="smcap">Gentle Shepherd</span>," published in that year in the "Tea-table
Miscellany."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It occurs in the edition of 1761, but it
is not in those of 1788 and 1798. We have given it complete
in the Notes at page 90. In a foot-note to the "Life" at
page xviii, will be found a statement, explanatory of the causes
why these additional songs were inserted. We quite agree
with the writer of that Note, that they mar the beauty of
the poem; and, in this edition, we would have preferred to
follow the example of David Allan and Foulis in that of
1788; but, it being the opinion of the Publisher, that the
Pastoral, in such a form, would be generally considered incomplete,
they have been inserted in the usual manner.
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>
<p>
For these eighteen extra songs we have not had what
we can consider a standard text: they have been printed
from the edition of 1798, collated with those of 1788 and
1808. We also compared them with those in the "Tea-table
Miscellany" of 1733, the oldest copy in our possession,
and found no difference of any consequence.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="smcap">Glossaries</span> heretofore appended to the "<span class="smcap">Gentle
Shepherd</span>" have been, usually, reprints of that given by
Ramsay in the quarto of 1728, which was prepared for his
Poems, complete: that in the edition of 1800 being considerably
enlarged. In the present edition the Glossary has
been restricted chiefly to those words and phrases which
occur in the Pastoral; of which, upwards of a hundred and
fifty have been omitted in every former edition that we have
seen: those are now added, with explanations. The rest of
the Glossary has been carefully examined, and some corrections
made.
</p>
<p>
In the "<span class="smcap">Life</span> of Ramsay, by Tennant," we have made
one or two corrections; and some additions, derived from
various sources, have been inserted. These are distinguished
by being enclosed in brackets.
</p>
<p>
The elaborate <span class="smcap">Essay</span> by Lord Woodhouselee "on the
Genius and Writings of Allan Ramsay," so far as it refers
to the "<span class="smcap">Gentle Shepherd</span>," we have given complete, excepting
a few quotations in Italian. To this have been
added, opinions and criticisms on the Pastoral, by various
celebrated authors. These are not entirely confined to expressions
of approbation; that of Pinkerton being quite the
reverse, although, as we think, singularly unjust.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="smcap">Portrait</span> prefixed to this edition is a careful and
accurate copy of the print given by Cadell and Davies, in
their edition of 1800; respecting which they make the
following statement:&mdash;"there is prefixed a portrait of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
author, which has been finely engraved by Mr. Ryder, from
a drawing which was made by Allan Ramsay, the poet's
son; the original of which is now in the possession of A. F.
Tytler, Esq., of Edinburgh."
</p>
<p>
In order that we may not be charged with negligence,
we subjoin a list of all the editions of the "<span class="smcap">Gentle Shepherd</span>"
to which we have had access during the preparation
of the present edition; with a few slight remarks as to the
character of these editions.

<p class="center spaced medium p2">OF</p>
<p class="center spaced large p2">ALLAN RAMSAY.</p>
<p class="center medium p2"><i>Born 1686.&mdash;Died 1758.</i></p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcap">Allan Ramsay</span>, the restorer of Scottish Poetry, was born
on the 15th day of October, 1686, at Leadhills, in the parish
of Crawfordmoor, in Lanarkshire. His father, John Ramsay,
superintended Lord Hopetoun's lead mines at that place; and
his grandfather, Robert Ramsay, a writer or attorney in Edinburgh,
had possessed the same appointment: his great-grandfather,
Captain John Ramsay, was the son of Ramsay of
Cockpen in Mid-Lothian, who was brother of Ramsay of
Dalhousie. His mother, Alice Bower, was daughter of Allan
Bower, a gentleman of Derbyshire, whom Lord Hopetoun had
brought to Scotland to instruct and superintend his miners.
His grandmother, Janet Douglas, was daughter of Douglas of
Muthil. In his lineage, therefore, our Poet had something to
boast of, and, though <i>born to nae lairdship</i>, he fails not to congratulate
himself on being sprung from the loins of a Douglas.
He did not long enjoy the blessing of paternal care and instruction;
for, shortly after his birth, his father died, leaving
the widow and family in a condition rather destitute. His
mother soon after married a Mr. Crichton, a petty landholder
of the same county, by whom she had several children. Under
these unfortunate circumstances, young Allan entered upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
career of life; and, for fourteen years he remained in the house
of his stepfather, with no other education than was supplied
by the school of the parish. Here, surrounded by wild and
mountainous scenery, and amid an artless and secluded people,
whose manners and language were of patriarchal simplicity,
his childhood received those pastoral and Arcadian impressions,
which were too lively to be effaced by future habits, however
uncongenial, and of which he in his manhood, amid all the
artificial life of the city, made so lively and fascinating a
transcription.
</p>
<p>
Of his progress and attainments at school, we have no
record. It does not appear that he read much poetry prior to
his twentieth year; and his emulation, and <i>ambitious thoughts</i>,
of which he says <i>he had some</i>, seem to have slumbered in inactivity,
till they were awakened to unceasing exercise by the
society and the excitements of Edinburgh.
</p>
<p>
To Edinburgh he was sent in his fifteenth year, when the
felicity of his boyhood had been broken by the death of his
mother. We have the assurance of undoubted testimony, that
at that early age, when his mind was beginning to search
about for the choice of a profession, his wishes were to be a
painter; a circumstance too little known, and too little noticed
by his biographers, but strongly indicative, in our opinion, of
the aspirations of his youthful disposition. While yet in the
country, he had been in the practice of amusing himself with
copying such prints as he found in the books of his mother's
house. This early predilection for an art kindred to that
wherein he afterwards excelled, very likely followed bins
through life, and led him to devote his son to that favourite
study, from which he himself was so harshly precluded. For
his stepfather, little consulting the inclination of young Allan,
and wishing as soon as possible, and at any rate, to disencumber
himself of the charge of his support, bound this nursling
of the Muses apprentice to a wig-maker. Lowly as this
profession is, it has been vindicated by one of Ramsay's biographers
into comparative dignity, by separating it from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
kindred business of barber, with which it is vulgarly, and too
frequently confounded. Ramsay was never, it seems, a barber;
his enemies never blotted him with that ignominy; his calling
of "scull-thacker," as he himself ludicrously terms it, was too
dignified to be let down into an equality with the men of the
razor.
</p>
<p>
Thus from the beginning his business was with <i>the heads of
men</i>. We know not on what authority it is asserted by some
of his biographers, that he abandoned this profession on finishing
his apprenticeship: he is called wig-maker in the parish
record down to the year 1716; and we suspect he continued so
till the year 1718, or 1719, for in one of Hamilton's letters to
him, dated 24th of July, 1719, mention is made of his "new
profession."
</p>
<p>
He was in 1712 induced, as one of his biographers observes,
<i>by the example of other citizens</i>, to enter into the state of marriage.
His wife's name was Christian Ross, daughter of a
writer in Edinburgh, who brought him, year after year, a
numerous family of three sons and five daughters. Of this
family, Allan, the eldest, and the only son who survived him,
inherited the genius of his father, and, having received a liberal
education, became afterwards conspicuous as a scholar, and a
painter.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>
About the year 1711 or 1712 our Poet seems first to have
ventured into the regions of rhyme. The clubs and societies
of Edinburgh had provoked in him this new passion, and his
earliest effort, so far as is known, is an Address, supplicatory
of admission, "To the most happy members of the Easy Club,"
a production bearing every mark of unskilfulness and juvenility.
Of this club he was afterwards appointed poet-laureate,
in which capacity he was wont to recite to that jolly fraternity
his successive productions, for their criticisms and their applause.
</p>
<p>
Many of these poems were published in a detached form at
a penny a-piece, and his name became by this means celebrated
in the city. About the year 1716, and ere he relinquished his
avocation of wig-maker, he published an edition of the excellent
old poem of "Christ's Kirk on the Green," with a second canto
by himself. Having thus associated himself in the walks of
humour with the King of Scotland, he was induced, by the
approbation which he gained, and the rapid sale of the book, to
"keep a little more company with these comical characters,"
and to complete the story, by adding afterwards a third canto.
This attempt was crowned with all the success he anticipated,
and numerous editions of the work afforded him satisfactory
proof, that, in the public opinion, he had not unworthily put
himself into partnership with the royal humourist.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
</p>

<p>
Elevated by the distinction his productions had now procured
him, and losing at last all liking to a business which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
at utter variance with his ambition and darling amusements;
he commenced bookseller, most probably in the year 1718,
when he was in the thirty-second year of his age. This was
a trade at once more congenial to his habits, and more likely to
be lucrative, on account of his being already recommended by
his authorship to the buyers of books. His first shop as a bookseller
was in the High-street opposite to Niddry's-wynd, with
the figure of Mercury for his sign. From this shop proceeded,
in 1721, a collection of his various poems in one quarto volume,
published by subscription, which contained every eminent name
in Scotland. It was thus advertised in the Edinburgh Evening
Courant: "The poems of Allan Ramsay, in a large quarto
volume, fairly printed, with notes, and a complete glossary (as
promised to the subscribers), being now finished; all who have
generously contributed to carrying on of the design, may call
for their copies as soon as they please, from the author, at the
Mercury, opposite to Niddry's-wynd, Edinburgh."
</p>
<p>
From the sale of this volume he realized 400 guineas, which
was in those days a very considerable profit on a book of Scottish
poetry. In 1722 he gave to the world his Fables and Tales;
in the same year his tale of The Three Bonnets; and in 1724
his poem on Health. In January, 1724, he published the first
volume of the Tea-table Miscellany, being a collection of Scottish
and English songs; this volume was speedily followed by
a second; [in 1727] by a third; [and some years afterwards by
a fourth; all] under the same title. Hamilton of Bangour, and
Mallet, assisted him by their lyrical contributions. Encouraged
by the popularity of these books, he published, in October,
1724, the Evergreen, "a collection of Scots poems written by
the ingenious before 1600." For the duties of an editor of such
a work, it is generally agreed that Ramsay was not well fitted.
For, neither had he a complete knowledge of the ancient Scottish
language, nor was his literary conscience sufficiently tender
and scrupulous to that fidelity, which is required by the office
of editor. He abridged, he varied, modernized, and superadded.
In that collection first appeared under a feigned signature his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Vision, a poem, full of genius, and rich with Jacobitism, but disguising
the author and his principles under the thin concealment
of antique orthography.
</p>
<p>
At length appeared in 1725 his master-work, the Gentle
Shepherd, of which two scenes had been previously printed,
[the first] in 1721, under the title of Patie and Roger, and [the
second] in 1723, under that of Jenny and Meggy. [In the
quarto of 1721, there is likewise to be found (Sang XI.) the
dialogue song between Patie and Peggy, afterwards introduced
into the second act.] The reputation he had obtained by these
detached scenes, and the admonitions of his friends, who perceived
how easily and how happily they could be connected,
induced him to re-model and embody them into a regular pastoral
drama. Its success corresponded to his own hopes, and to
his friends' anticipations. [In the following letter, (published
for the first time by R. Chambers in his Scottish Biographical
Dictionary, 1835,) it will be seen that he was engaged on this
task in spring, 1724.
</p>

<blockquote><p class="center medium"><span class="smcap">Allan Ramsay</span> to <span class="smcap">William Ramsay</span>, of <span class="smcap">Templehall</span>, Esq.
</p>
<p class="right medium">"Edinburgh, <i>April</i> 8th, 1724.</p>

<p class="medium">"Sir,&mdash;These come to bear you my very heartyest and grateful wishes.
May you long enjoy your Marlefield, see many a returning spring pregnant
with new beautys; may everything that's excellent in its kind
continue to fill your extended soul with pleasure. Rejoyce in the
beneficence of heaven, and let all about ye rejoyce&mdash;whilst we, alake,
the laborious insects of a smoaky city, hurry about from place to place
in one eternal maze of fatiguing cares, to secure this day our daylie

gush from the earth. Once, I had a notion how fragrant the fields
were after a soft shower; and often, time out of mind! the glowing
blushes of the morning have fired my breast with raptures. Then it
was that the mixture of rural music echo'd agreeable from the surrounding
hills, and all nature appear'd in gayety.</p>

<p class="medium">"However, what is wanting to me of rural sweets I endeavour to
make up by being continually at the acting of some new farce, for I'm
grown, I know not how, so very wise, or at least think so (which is
much about one), that the mob of mankind afford me a continual diversion;
and this place, tho' little, is crowded with merry-andrews, fools,

</blockquote>

<p>A second edition followed next year, and numerous impressions
spread his fame, not only through Scotland, but through
the united kingdom, and the colonies. His name became
known, principally through this drama, to the wits of England,
and Pope took delight in reading his pastoral, the obscurer
phraseology of which was interpreted to him by Gay, who,
during his residence in Scotland, had been careful to instruct
himself in its dialect, that he might act as interpreter to the
poet of Twickenham.</p>

<p>In 1726 our Poet, now a thriving bookseller, removed
from his original dwelling at the Mercury opposite Niddry's-wynd,
to a shop in the east end of the Luckenbooths, which
was afterwards occupied by the late Mr. Creech, (whose Fugitive
Pieces are well known), and, after his death, by his
successor Mr. Fairbairn. With his shop he changed his sign,
and leaving Mercury, under the protection of whose witty
godship he had so flourished, he set up the friendly heads of
Ben Jonson and Drummond of Hawthornden. Here he sold
books, and established a circulating library, the first institution
of that kind, not only in Scotland, but we believe in Great
Britain.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The situation being near the Cross, and commanding
a full view of the High-street, his shop became the resort
of all the wits of the city; and here Gay, who is described
by Mr. Tytler, as "a little pleasant-looking man, with a tyewig,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
used to look out upon the population of Edinburgh,
while Ramsay pointed out to him the principal characters as
they passed. Of this house no vestiges now remain, for as
the beauty and magnificence of the High-street had been
long disfigured by the cumbrous and gloomy buildings called
the Luckenbooths, they were, a few years ago, completely
removed, and the street cleared of that misplaced mass of
deformity.</p>

<p>In 1728 he printed in quarto a second volume, containing,
[his portrait by Smibert, and,] with other poems, a Masque
on the Marriage of the Duke of Hamilton, one of his most
ingenious productions; [also the Gentle Shepherd, complete.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>]
Of this quarto an octavo edition followed next year; and so
extended was now the circle of his reputation, and so universal
the demand for his poems, that the London booksellers published
an edition of his Works in 1731, and two years after
an edition also appeared at Dublin. His collection of thirty
Fables appeared in 1730, when he was in his 45th year, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
which period the public received nothing from his pen. "I
e'en gave o'er in good time," he says, in his letter to Smibert,
"ere the coolness of fancy attending advanced years made me
risk the reputation I had acquired."</p>

<p>He now therefore intermeddled no longer with the anxieties
of authorship, but sat down in the easy chair of his celebrity
to enjoy his laurels and his profits. After a lapse of six years
of silence, and of happiness, his ardour for dramatic exhibitions
involved him in some circumstances of perplexity, attended, it
is believed, with pecuniary loss. As Edinburgh possessed as
yet no fixed place for the exhibition of the drama, he endeavoured
to supply that deficiency to the citizens, by building, at
his own expense a theatre in Carrubber's-close. Shortly after,
the Act for licensing the stage was passed, which at once
blasted all his hopes of pleasure and advantage; for, the Magistrates
availing themselves of the power entrusted to them
by the Act, shewed no indulgence to the author of the Gentle
Shepherd, but, in the true spirit of that puritanism which
reckons as ungodly all jollity of heart, and relaxation of countenance,
they shut up his theatre, leaving the citizens without
exhilaration, and our poet without redress. This was not all;
he was assailed with the satirical mockery of his laughter-hating
enemies, who turned against him his own weapons of
poetical raillery. Pamphlets appeared, entitled, "The flight
of religious piety from Scotland, upon the account of Ramsay's
lewd books, and the hell-bred playhouse comedians, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
debauch all the faculties of the soul of our rising generation;"&mdash;"A
looking-glass for Allan Ramsay;"&mdash;"The dying words of
Allan Ramsay." These maligners, in the bitterness of their
sanctimonious resentments, reproached him with "having acquired
wealth,"&mdash;with "possessing a fine house,"&mdash;with "having
raised his kin to high degree;" all which vilifications must
have carried along with them some secret and sweet consolations
into the bosom of our bard. Amid the perplexities
caused by the suppression of his theatre, he applied by a
poetical petition to his friend the Honourable Duncan Forbes,
then Lord President of the Court of Session, in order that he
might obtain some compensation for his expenses; but with
what success is not recorded by any of his biographers.</p>

<p>His theatrical adventure being thus unexpectedly crushed,
he devoted himself to the duties of his shop, and the education
of his children. He sent in 1736 his son Allan to Rome, there
to study that art by which he rose to such eminence. In the
year 1743 he lost his wife, who was buried on the 28th of
March in the cemetery of the Greyfriars. He built, probably
about this time, a whimsical house of an octagon form, on the
north side of the Castle-hill, where his residence is still known
by the name of Ramsay-Garden. [The site of this house was
selected with the taste of a poet and the judgment of a painter.
It commanded a reach of scenery probably not surpassed in
Europe, extending from the mouth of the Forth on the east to
the Grampians on the west, and stretching far across the green
hills of Fife to the north; embracing in the including space
every variety of beauty, of elegance, and of grandeur.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>] This
house he deemed a paragon of architectural invention. He
showed it with exultation to the late Lord Elibank, telling his
Lordship at the same time, that the wags of the town likened
it to a "goose-pye:" "Indeed, Allan," replied his Lordship,
"now that I see you in it, I think it is well named."</p>

<p>Having for several years before his death retired from business,
he gave himself up in this fantastical dwelling to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
varied amusements of reading, conversation, and the cultivation
of his garden. Being now "loose frae care and strife," he
enjoyed, in the calmness and happiness of a philosophical old
age, all the fruits of his many and well rewarded labours. A
considerable part of every summer was spent in the country
with his friends, of whom he had many, distinguished both for
talents and rank. The chief of these were, Sir Alexander Dick
of Prestonfield, and Sir John Clerk of Pennycuik, one of the
Barons of Exchequer, a gentleman who united taste to scholarship,
and had patronized and befriended Ramsay from the
beginning. This amiable gentleman died in 1756, a loss which
must have been severely felt by our Poet, and which he himself
did not long survive. He had been afflicted for some time with
a scorbutic complaint in his gums, which after depriving him
of his teeth, and consuming part of the jaw-bone, at last put an
end to his sufferings and his existence on the 7th of January,
1758, in the 72d year of his age. He was interred in the
cemetery of Greyfriars' church on the 9th of that month, and
in the record of mortality he is simply called, "Allan Ramsay,
Poet, who died of old age."</p>

<p>Of his person, Ramsay has given us a minute and pleasant
description. He was about five feet four inches high,</p>

<p class="medium">
<span class="i2">"A blackavic'd<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> snod<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> dapper fallow,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Nor lean, nor overlaid with tallow."</span>
</p>

<p>He is described by those who knew him towards the latter
part of his life, as a squat man, with a belly rather portly, and
a countenance full of smiles and good humour. He wore a
round goodly wig rather short. His disposition may be easily
collected from his writings. He possessed that happy Horatian
temperament of mind, that forbids, for its own ease, all entrance
to the painful and irascible passions. He was a man rather
of pleasantry and laughter, than of resentment and moody
malignancy. His enemies, of whom he had some, he did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
deem so important as on their account to ruffle his peace of
mind, by indulging any reciprocal hostility, by which they
would have been flattered. He was kind, benevolent, cheerful;
possessing, like Burns, great susceptibility for social joys, but
regulating his indulgences more by prudence, and less impetuous
and ungovernable than the impassioned poet of Ayrshire.
By his genius he elevated himself to the notice of all
those of his countrymen who possessed either rank or talents;
but these attentions proceeded spontaneously from their admiration
of his talents, and were not courted by any servilities
or unworthy adulations. Never drawn from business by the
seductions of the bowl, or the invitations of the great, he consulted
his own respect, and the comfort of his family, by
attending to the duties of his shop, which so faithfully and
liberally rewarded him. His vanity (that constitutional failing
of all bards) is apparent in many of his writings, but it is
seasoned with playfulness and good humour. He considered,
indeed, that "pride in poets is nae sin," and on one occasion
jocularly challenges superiority in the temple of Fame, even
to Peter the Great of Russia, by saying, "But haud, proud
Czar, I wadna niffer<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> fame."&mdash;He is called by Mr. William
Tytler, who enjoyed his familiarity, "an honest man, and of
great pleasantry."</p>

<p>Of learning he had but little, yet he understood Horace
faintly in the original; a congenial author, with whom he
seems to have been much delighted, and in the perusal of
whose writings he was assisted by Ruddiman. He read
French, but knew nothing of Greek. He did not, however,
like Burns, make an appearance of vilifying that learning
of which he was so medium a partaker; he bewailed his
"own little knowledge of it;" and, like the Ayrshire bard,
he was sufficiently ostentatious and pedantic in the display
of what little he possessed.</p>

<p>He composed his verses with little effort or labour; his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
poetry seems to have evaporated lightly and airily from the
surface of a mind always jocose and at its ease. And as <i>it
lightly came</i>, he was wont to say, <i>so it lightly went</i>; for
after composition, he dismissed it from his mind without
further care or anxiety.</p>

<p>In 1759 an elegant obelisk was erected to the memory
of Ramsay, by Sir James Clerk, at his family-seat of Pennycuik,
containing the following inscription:</p>

<p class="p4 center">REMARKS ON THE WRITINGS OF ALLAN RAMSAY.</p>
<p class="center spaced p2">BY W. TENNANT.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Of Ramsay's Poems, the largest, and that on which his
fame chiefly rests, is his <i>Gentle Shepherd</i>. Though some of
his mediumer poems contain passages of greater smartness, yet
its more general interest as a whole, and the uniformity of
talent visible in its scenes, render it one of the finest specimens
of his genius. We have no hesitation in asserting,
that it is one of the best pastoral dramas in the wide circle
of European literature; an excellent production in a department
of writing in which the English language has as yet
nothing to boast of. While other modern tongues have been
enriching themselves with pastoral, the English, copious in
all other kinds, continues, in this, barren and deficient. No
English production, therefore, can enter into competition with
the Gentle Shepherd. We must look to the south of Europe
for similar and rival productions, with which it can be compared.
The shepherd plays of Tasso, and Guarini, and Bonarelli,
contain more invention, and splendour, and variety
of incident and of dialogue, than our Scottish drama; but
they have also more conceit and flimsiness of sentiment,
more artifice of language, more unnatural and discordant
contrivance of fable. <i>In its plot</i>, the Gentle Shepherd is
simple and natural, founded on a story whose circumstances,
if they did not really happen, are at least far within the
compass of verisimilitude. Its development is completed by
means interesting but probable, without the intervention of
gods, or satyrs, or oracles, or such heathenish and preposterous
machinery. <i>The characters</i> of the Gentle Shepherd
are all framed by the hand of one evidently well acquainted
with rural life and manners. They are not the puling, sickly,
and unimpressive phantoms that people the bowers of Italian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
pastoral; they are lively, stirring creatures, bearing in their
countenances the hardy lineaments of the country, and expressing
themselves with a plainness, and downright sincerity,
with which every mind sympathizes. They are rustics,
it is true, but they are polished, not only by their proximity
to the metropolis, but by the influence of the principal shepherd,
who, besides the gentility of blood that operates in
his veins,</p>

<p class="medium">
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;also reads and speaks,</span><br />
<span class="i2">With them that kens them, Latin words and Greeks.</span>
</p>

<p>The situations in which the persons are placed are so ingeniously
devised, as to draw forth from their bosoms all
those feelings and passions which accompany the shepherd,
life, and which are described with a happiness and a simplicity,
the truer to nature, on account of its being removed
from that over-wrought outrageousness of passion which we
sometimes think is the fault of modern writing. The tenderness
of correspondent affections,&mdash;the hesitation and anxiety
of a timid lover,&mdash;the mutual bliss on the mutual discovery
of long concealed attachment,&mdash;the uneasiness of jealousy,
with the humorous and condign punishment of its evil devices,&mdash;the
fidelity of the shepherd notwithstanding his elevation
to an unexpected rank,&mdash;the general happiness that
crowns, and winds up the whole, are all impressively and
vividly delineated.</p>

<p>With regard to <i>its sentiments</i>, the Gentle Shepherd has
nothing to be ashamed of; though in a very few places
coarse, the thoughts are nowhere impure; they have somewhat
of the purity of Gesner, with rather more vivacity and
vigour. There is no affectation; every character thinks as
country people generally do, artlessly, and according to nature.
With regard to <i>its language</i>, we know not whether to say
much, or to say little. Much has been already said, to redeem
from the charge of vulgarity a language once courtly
and dignified, but now associated with meanness of thought,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
and rudeness of manners. We do not think it necessary,
however, to stand up in defence of a dialect which has, since
the days of Ramsay, been ennobled by the poems of Burns,
and is eternized more lately in the tales of that mighty
genius, who sits on the summit of Northern Literature, and
flashes forth from behind his cloud his vivid and his fiery productions.
In the use of this dialect, Ramsay is extremely
fortunate; for Scottish shepherds he could have employed
none other; and he wields his weapon with a dexterity which
we do not think has been since exceeded. Out of his own
familiar language, he is indeed heavy and wearisome; English
armour is too cumbrous for him; he cannot move in
it with grace and activity. We find, accordingly, that in
his Gentle Shepherd the most unskilful passages are in English,
without beauty or energy; whereas his Scottish has
in it a felicity which has rendered it popular with all ranks,
and caused his verses to pass with proverbial currency among
the peasants of his native country.</p>

<p>Next in value to his Gentle Shepherd, we think, are his
imitations of Horace. To this good-humoured author Ramsay
had, from congeniality of mind, a strong predilection; and
he in some places has fully equalled, if not surpassed, his
prototype in happy hits of expression. Pope himself is not
so fortunate. Take for instance,</p>

<blockquote><p class="medium">
Daring and unco stout he was,<br />
With heart <i>hool'd in three sloughs</i><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of brass,<br />

<p>In his <i>Vision</i> there is more grandeur, and a nearer approach
to sublimity than in any other of his poems. He is
indeed, here, superior to himself, and comes nearer to the
strength and splendour of Dunbar, whose antiquated style
he copied. The 5th stanza may be a specimen.</p>

<p>His <i>Tales</i> and <i>Fables</i>, a species of writing which he himself
deemed as "casten for his share," display great ease
and readiness of versification, with much comic vivacity. The
best of these are the <i>Twa Cats and the Cheese</i>; the <i>Lure</i>,
in which the Falconer's "foregathering with auld Symmie"
is excellently described; and the <i>Monk and the Miller's Wife</i>,
for the story of which he is indebted to Dunbar. As a song
writer we are not inclined to give Ramsay a very high
place. His mind had not those deep and energetic workings
of feeling that fitted Burns so admirably for this difficult
species of writing. He is stiff, where passion is required;
and is most easy, as usual, where he is comic. Several of
his songs yet retain their popularity; but even of these none
are without some faults. We prefer the Highland Laddie,
Gie me a Lass wi' a Lump o' Land, The Carle he came o'er
the Craft, The Lass of Patie's Mill and Jenny Nettles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span></p>

<p>His <i>Christ's Kirk</i> is no mean effort of his muse; the
idea of continuing King James's production was good, and
he has executed it happily. Ramsay's humour must, however,
be acknowledged to be inferior to the pure, strong,
irresistible merriment that shines even through the dim and
nearly obsolete language of his royal master. In the <i>Third
Canto</i>, the morning, with its effect on the crapulous assemblage,
is well painted.</p>

<blockquote><p class="medium">

<p>Of a character similar to the first two lines of the above
stanza, are the following other passages of Ramsay's works,
which remind us a little of the Italian poets;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="medium">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span></p>

<p>To sum up our opinion of Ramsay's merits as a poet&mdash;he
was fortunate, and he deserved well, in being the first to
redeem the Muse of Scotland from wasting her strength in
a dead language, which, since the <i>days</i> of Buchanan, had
been the freezing vehicle of her exertions. He re-established
the popularity of a dialect, which, since the removal
of the Scottish Court, had received no honour from the pen
of genius, but which, near two hundred years before, had
been sublimed into poetical dignity by Dunbar and the
bards of that age. To Ramsay, and to his treasures of Scottish
phraseology, succeeding poets have been much indebted;
he knew the language well, and had imbibed the facetious
and colloquial spirit of its idioms. Ramsay, therefore, when
he employs his beloved dialect, manages it masterly, and,
though never lofty, he is always at his ease: Burns, in his
highest flights, soared out of it. The genius of the first was
pleasing, placid, versatile, in quest rather of knacks, and
felicities of expression, than originating bold and masculine
thoughts: The genius of the latter was richer, more original,
more impressive, and formidable, but less equal, and less
careful of the niceties and tricks of phraseology. The tone
of Ramsay's mind was good-humoured composure, and facile
pleasantry; of Burns's, intensity of feeling, tenderness, and
daring elevation approaching to sublimity. Of Burns's superiority
no man is doubtful; but Ramsay's merits will not be
forgotten; and the names of <i>both</i> will be forever cherished
by the lovers of Scottish poetry.

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As the writings of <i>Allan Ramsay</i> have now stood the
test of the public judgment, during more than seventy
years;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and, in the opinion of the best critics, he seems to
bid fair to maintain his station among our poets, it may be
no unpleasing, nor uninstructive employment, to examine the
grounds, on which that judgment is founded; to ascertain
the rank, which he holds in the scale of merit; and to state
the reasons, that may be given, for assigning him that distinguished
place among the original poets of his country, to
which I conceive he is entitled.</p>

<p>The genius of Ramsay was original; and the powers of
his untutored mind were the gift of nature, freely exercising
itself within the sphere of its own observation. Born in a
wild country, and accustomed to the society of its rustic inhabitants,
the poet's talents found their first exercise in
observing the varied aspects of the mountains, rivers, and
vallies; and the no less varied, though simple manners, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
the rude people, with whom he conversed. He viewed the
former with the enthusiasm which, in early childhood, is
the inseparable attendant of genius; and on the latter he
remarked, with that sagacity of discriminating observation,
which instructed the future moralist, and gave the original
intimations to the contemporary satirist. With this predisposition
of mind, it is natural to imagine, that the education,
which he certainly received, opened to him such sources of
instruction as English literature could furnish; and his
kindred talents directed his reading chiefly to such of the
<i>poets</i> as occasion threw in his way.</p>

<p>Inheriting that ardour of feeling, which is generally accompanied
with strong sentiments of moral excellence, and
keenly awake even to those slighter deviations from propriety,
which constitute the foibles of human conduct, he
learned, as it were from intuition, the glowing language,
which is best fitted for the scourge of vice; as well as the
biting ridicule, which is the most suitable corrective of gross
impropriety, without deviating into personal lampoon.</p>

<p>A consciousness of his own talents induced <i>Ramsay</i> to
aspire beyond the situation of a mere mechanic; and the
early notice, which his first poetical productions procured
him, was a natural motive for the experiment of a more
liberal profession, which connected him easily with those
men of wit, who admired, and patronised him. As a book-seller,
he had access to a more respectable class in society.
We may discern, in the general tenor of his compositions, a
respectful demeanour towards the great, and the rich, which,
though it never descends to adulation or servility, and generally
seeks for an apology in some better endowments than
mere birth or fortune, is yet a sensible mark, that these
circumstances had a strong influence on his mind.</p>

<p>As he extended the sphere of his acquaintance, we may
presume, that his knowledge of men, and acquaintance with
manners, were enlarged; and, in his latter compositions, we
may discern a sufficient intelligence of those general topics,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
which engaged the public attention. The habits of polite
life, and the subjects of fashionable conversation, were become
familiar, at this time, to the citizens of Edinburgh, from the
periodical papers of <i>Addison</i> and <i>Steele</i>; and the wits of
<i>Balfour's</i> Coffee-house, <i>Forrester</i>, <i>Falconer</i>, <i>Bennet</i>, <i>Clerk</i>,
<i>Hamilton</i> of Bangour, <i>Preston</i>, and <i>Crawford</i>,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> were a miniature
of the society, which was to be met with at <i>Will's</i>
and <i>Button's</i>.</p>

<p>The political principles of <i>Ramsay</i> were those of an old
Scotsman, proud of his country, delighted to call to mind
its ancient honours, while it held the rank of a distinct
kingdom, and attached to the succession of its ancient
princes. Of similar sentiments, at that time, were many of
the Scotish gentry. The chief friends of the poet were
probably men, whose sentiments on those subjects agreed
with his own; and the Easy Club, of which he was an
original member, consisted of youths who were anti-unionists.
Yet, among the patrons of <i>Ramsay</i>, were some men of rank,
who were actuated by very different principles, and whose
official situation would have made it improper for them,
openly, to countenance a poet, whose opinions were obnoxious
to the rulers of his country. Of this he was aware;
and putting a just value on the friendship of those distinguished
persons, he learnt to be cautious in the expression
of any opinions, which might risk the forfeiture of their
esteem: hence he is known to have suppressed some of his
earlier productions, which had appeared only in manuscript;
and others, which prudence forbad him to publish, were
ushered into the world without his name, and even with
false signatures. Among the former was a poem to the
memory of the justly celebrated <i>Dr. Pitcairne</i>, which was
printed by the Easy Club, but never published; and among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
the latter, is <i>The Vision</i>, which he printed in the <i>Evergreen</i>,
with the signature of <span class="smcap">Ar. Scot</span>.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>In Ramsay's <i>Vision</i>, the author, in order to aid the deception,
has made use of a more antiquated phraseology,
than that, which we find in his other Scotish poems: but,
it evidently appears from this attempt, and from the two
cantos, which he added to <i>King James the First's</i> ludicrous
satire of <i>Christ's Kirk on the Green</i>, that <i>Ramsay</i> was not
much skilled in the ancient Scotish dialect. Indeed the
Glossary, which he annexed to the two quarto volumes of
his poems, wherein are many erroneous interpretations, is
of itself sufficient proof of this assertion. In compiling the
Glossary of his Evergreen, <i>Lord Hailes</i> has remarked, that
he does not seem ever to have consulted the Glossary to
<i>Douglas's Virgil</i>; "and yet they who have not consulted it,
cannot acquire a competent knowledge of the ancient Scotish
dialect, unless by infinite and ungrateful labour."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> A part
of this labour undoubtedly may be ascribed to <i>Ramsay</i>, when
he selected and transcribed, from the <i>Bannatyne manuscript</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
those ancient poems, which chiefly compose the two volumes
of his <i>Evergreen</i>: and hence, it is probable, he derived the
most of what he knew of the older dialect of his country.
His own stock was nothing else than the oral language of
the farmers of the <i>Lothians</i>, and the common talk of the
citizens of Edinburgh, to which his ears were constantly
accustomed. A Scotsman, in the age of Ramsay, generally
<i>wrote</i> in English; that is, he imitated the style of the English
writers; but when he <i>spoke</i>, he used the language of
his country. The sole peculiarity of the style of Ramsay is,
that he transferred the oral language to his writings. He
could write, as some of his compositions evince, in a style
which may be properly termed English verse; but he wrote
with more ease in the Scotish dialect, and he preferred it, as
judging, not unreasonably, that it conferred a kind of Doric
simplicity, which, when he wished to paint with fidelity the
manners of his countrymen, and the peculiarities of the
lower orders, was extremely suitable to such subjects.</p>

<p>From these considerations, one cannot but wonder at the
observation, which is sometimes made even by Scotsmen of
good taste, that the language of <i>The Gentle Shepherd</i> disgusts
from its vulgarity. It is true, that in the present
day, the Scotish dialect is heard only in the mouths of the
lowest of the populace, in whom it is generally associated
with vulgarity of sentiment; but those critics should recollect,
that it was the language of the Scotish people, which
was to be imitated, and that too of the people upwards of
a century ago, if we carry our mind back to the epoch of
the scene.</p>

<p>If <i>Ramsay</i> had made the shepherds of the Lowlands of
Scotland, in the middle of the seventeenth century, speak
correct English, how preposterous would have been such a
composition! But, with perfect propriety, he gave them the
language which belonged to them; and if the sentiments of
the speakers be not reproachable with unnecessary vulgarity,
we cannot with justice associate vulgarism with a dialect,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
which in itself is proper, and in its application is characteristic.
After all, what is the language of Ramsay, but
the common speech of Yorkshire during the last century?<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>But, as associated ideas arise only where the connection
is either in itself necessary, or the relation is so intimate,
the two ideas are seldom found disunited; so of late years,
that disunion has taken place in a twofold manner; for the
language, even of the common people of Scotland, is gradually
refining, and coming nearer to the English standard;
and it has fortunately happened, that the Scotish dialect
has lately been employed in compositions of transcendant
merit, which have not only exhibited the finest strokes of
the pathetic, but have attained even to a high pitch of the
sublime. For the truth of this observation, we may appeal
to <i>The Cotter's Saturday Night</i>, and <i>The Vision of Burns</i>.
In these, the language, so far from conveying the idea of
vulgarity, appears most eminently suited to the sentiment,
which seems to derive, from its simplicity, additional tenderness,
and superior elevation.</p>

<p>The Scots, and the English, languages are, indeed, nothing
more than different dialects of the same radical
tongue, namely, the Anglo-Saxon; and, setting prejudice
apart, (which every preference, arising from such associations,
as we have mentioned, must be,) it would not perhaps
be difficult, on a fair investigation of the actual merits of
both the dialects, to assert the superior advantages of the
Scotish to the English, for many species of original composition.
But a discussion of this kind would lead too far;
and it is but incidentally connected with the proper subject
of these remarks.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> It is enough to say, that the merits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
of those very compositions, on which we are now to offer
some remarks, are of themselves a sufficient demonstration
of the powers of that language in which, chiefly, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
are composed, for many, if not for all the purposes of
poetry.</p>

<p class="center medium">
(<i>Remarks on Ramsay's miscellaneous poems are here omitted.</i>)<br />
</p>

<p>In the year 1725, <i>Ramsay</i> published his pastoral comedy
of <i>The Gentle Shepherd</i>, the noblest and most permanent
monument of his fame. A few years before, he had published,
in a single sheet, <i>A Pastoral Dialogue between Patie
and Roger</i>, which was reprinted in the first collection of his
poems, in 1721. This composition being much admired, his
literary friends urged him to extend his plan to a regular
drama: and to this fortunate suggestion the literary world
is indebted for one of the most perfect pastoral poems that
has ever appeared.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The <i>pastoral drama</i> is an invention of the moderns. The
first who attempted this species of poetry was <i>Agostino de
Beccari</i>, in his <i>Sacrificio Favola Pastorale</i>, printed in 1553.
<i>Tasso</i> is supposed to have taken the hint from him; and is
allowed, in his <i>Aminta</i>, published in 1573, to have far surpassed
his master. <i>Guarini</i> followed, whose <i>Pastor Fido</i>
contends for the palm with the <i>Aminta</i>, and, in the general
opinion of the Italians, is judged to have obtained it. <i>Tasso</i>
himself is said to have confessed the superior merit of his
rival's work; but to have added, in his own defence, that
had <i>Guarini</i> never seen his <i>Aminta</i>, he never would have
surpassed it. Yet, I think, there is little doubt, that this
preference is ill-founded. Both these compositions have
resplendent beauties, with glaring defects and improprieties.
I am, however, much mistaken, if the latter are not more
abundant in the <i>Pastor Fido</i>, as the former are predominant
in the <i>Aminta</i>. Both will ever be admired, for beauty of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
poetical expression, for rich imagery, and for detached sentiments
of equal delicacy and tenderness: but the fable, both
of the <i>Aminta</i>, and <i>Pastor Fido</i>, errs against all probability;
and the general language and sentiments of the characters
are utterly remote from nature. The fable of the <i>Aminta</i>
is not dramatic; for it is such, that the principal incidents,
on which the plot turns, are incapable of representation:
the beautiful <i>Silvia</i>, stripped naked, and bound by her hair
to a tree by a brutal satyr, and released by her lover
<i>Amyntas</i>;&mdash;her flight from the wolves;&mdash;the precipitation
of <i>Amyntas</i> from a high rock, who narrowly escapes being
dashed in pieces, by having his fall broken by the stump
of a tree;&mdash;are all incidents, incapable of being represented
to the eye; and must therefore be thrown into narration.
The whole of the last act is narrative, and is taken up
entirely with the history of <i>Amyntas's</i> fall, and the happy
change produced in the heart of the rigorous <i>Silvia</i>, when
she found her lover thus miraculously preserved from the
cruel death, to which her barbarity had prompted him to
expose himself.</p>

<p>Yet, the fable of the <i>Aminta</i>, unnatural and undramatic,
as it is, has the merit of simplicity. That of the <i>Pastor
Fido</i>, equally unnatural and incredible, has the additional
demerit of being complicated as well as absurd. The distress
of <i>Amyntas</i>, arising from an adequate and natural
cause&mdash;rejected love, excites our sympathy; but the distress
in the <i>Pastor Fido</i> is altogether chimerical; we have no
sympathy with the calamities arising from the indignation
of <i>Diana</i>, or the supposed necessity of accomplishing the
absurd and whimsical response of an <i>oracle</i>. We cannot
be affected by the passions of fictitious beings. The love
of a <i>satyr</i> has nothing in it but what is odious and disgusting.</p>

<p>The defects of these celebrated poems have arisen from
the erroneous idea entertained by their authors, that the
province of this species of poetry was not to imitate nature,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
but to paint that chimerical state of society, which is termed
the <i>golden age</i>. <i>Mr. Addison</i>, who, in the Guardian, has
treated the subject of pastoral poetry at considerable length,
has drawn his critical rules from that absurd principle; for
he lays it down as a maxim, that, to form a right judgment
of pastoral poetry, it is necessary to cast back our
eyes on the first ages of the world, and inquire into the
manners of men, "before they were formed into large
societies, cities built, or commerce established: a state," says
he, "of ease, innocence, and contentment; where plenty
begot pleasure, and pleasure begot singing, and singing
begot poetry, and poetry begot singing again:" a description
this, which is so fantastical, as would almost persuade
us, that the writer meant to ridicule his own doctrine, if
the general strain of his criticism did not convince us it
was seriously delivered. Is it necessary to prove, that this
notion of pastoral poetry, however founded, in the practice
of celebrated writers, has no foundation in fact, no basis in
reason, nor conformity to good sense? To a just taste, and
unadulterated feelings, the natural beauties of the country,
the simple manners, rustic occupations, and rural enjoyments
of its inhabitants, brought into view by the medium of a
well-contrived dramatic fable, must afford a much higher
degree of pleasure, than any chimerical fiction, in which
Arcadian nymphs and swains hold intercourse with Pan and
his attendant fauns and satyrs. If the position be disputed,
let the <i>Gentle Shepherd</i> be fairly compared with the
<i>Aminta</i>, and, <i>Pastor Fido</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>story</i> of the <i>Gentle Shepherd</i> is fitted to excite the
warmest interest, because the situations, into which the
characters are thrown, are strongly affecting, whilst they are
strictly consonant to nature and probability. The whole of
the <i>fable</i> is authorized by the circumstances of the times, in
which the action of the piece is laid. The era of <i>Cromwell's</i>
usurpation, when many loyal subjects, sharing the
misfortunes of their exiled sovereign, were stripped of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
estates, and then left to the neglect and desolation of forfeiture;
the necessity under which those unhappy sufferers
often lay, of leaving their infant progeny under the charge
of some humble but attached dependant, till better days
should dawn upon their fortunes; the criminal advantages
taken by false friends in usurping the rights of the sufferers,
and securing themselves against future question by
deeds of guilt; these circumstances, too well founded in
truth, and nature, are sufficient to account for every particular
in this most interesting drama, and give it perfect
verisimilitude.</p>

<p>The <i>fables</i> of the <i>Aminta</i> and <i>Pastor Fido</i>, drawn from
a state of society which never had an existence, are, for
that reason, incapable of exciting any high degree of interest;
and the mind cannot for a moment remain under
the influence of that deception, which it is the great purpose
of the drama to produce.</p>

<p>The <i>characters</i> or <i>persons</i> of the Italian pastorals are coy
nymphs and swains, whose sole occupation is hunting wild
beasts, brutal satyrs who plot against the chastity of those
nymphs, shepherds deriving their origin from the gods,
stupid priests of these gods who are the dupes of their
ambiguous will, and gods themselves disguised like shepherds,
and influencing the conduct and issue of the piece.
The manners of these unnatural and fictitious beings are
proper to their ideal character. A dull moralizing chorus
is found necessary to explain what the characters themselves
must have left untold, or unintelligible.</p>

<p>The <i>persons</i> of the Scotish pastoral are the actual inhabitants
of the country where the scene is laid; their manners
are drawn from nature with a faithful pencil. The contrast
of the different characters is happily imagined, and supported
with consummate skill. <i>Patie</i>, of a cheerful and
sanguine temperament; spirited, yet free from vain ambition;
contented with his humble lot; endowed by nature with a
superior understanding, and feeling in himself those internal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span>
sources of satisfaction, which are independent of the adventitious
circumstances of rank and fortune. <i>Roger</i>, of a grave
and phlegmatic constitution; of kind affections, but of that
ordinary turn of mind, which is apt to suppose some necessary
connection between the possession of wealth and
felicity. The former, from native dignity of character,
assuming a bold pre-eminence, and acting the part of a
tutor and counsellor to his friend, who bends, though with
some reluctance, to the authority of a nobler mind. The
principal female characters are contrasted with similar skill,
and equal power of discrimination. <i>Peggy</i>, beautiful in
person as in mind, endowed with every quality that can
adorn the character of woman; gentle, tender-hearted, constant
in affection, free from vanity as from caprice; of
excellent understanding; judging of others by the criterion
of her own innocent mind, and therefore forming the most
amiable views of human nature. <i>Jenny</i>, sensible and affectionate,
sprightly and satirical; possessing the ordinary
qualities of her sex, self-love, simulation, and the passion
of conquest; and pleased with exercising a capricious dominion
over the mind of a lover; judging of mankind rather
from the cold maxims of instilled prudential caution, than
from the native suggestions of the heart.&mdash;A contrast of
characters strongly and skilfully opposed, and therefore
each most admirably fitted to bring the other into full
display.</p>

<p>The subordinate persons of the drama are drawn with
equal skill and fidelity to their prototypes. <i>Glaud</i> and
<i>Symon</i> are the genuine pictures of the old Scotish yeomanry,
the Lothian farmers of the last age, in their manners,
sentiments, and modes of life; humble, but respectable;
homely, yet comfortable. The episode of <i>Bauldy</i>, while it
gives a pleasing variety, without interrupting the principal
action, serves to introduce a character of a different species,
as a foil to the honest and simple worth of the former. It
paints in strong colours, and exposes to merited reprobation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>
and contempt, that low and sordid mind, which seeks
alone the gratification of its own desires, though purchased
by the misery of the object of its affection. Bauldy congratulates
himself on the cruel disappointment of Peggy's
love;&mdash;"<i>I hope we'll a' sleep sound, but ane, this night</i>;"&mdash;and
judges her present situation of deep distress to be the
most favourable moment for preferring his own suit. His
punishment, as it is suitable to his demerits, gives entire
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The <i>Aminta</i>, and <i>Pastor Fido</i>, abound in beautiful sentiments,
and passages of the most tender and natural simplicity;
but it is seldom we find a single page, in which
this pleasing impression is not effaced by some affected and
forced conceit. Nothing can be more delicately beautiful,
or more agreeable to the true simplicity of pastoral, than
<i>Amyntas's</i> recounting to <i>Tircis</i> the rise of his passion for
Silvia. The description of their joint occupations and
sports, till love insensibly arose in the breast of <i>Tircis</i>;
the natural and innocent device he employed to obtain a
kiss from <i>Silvia</i>; the discovery of his affection, and his despair
on finding her heart insensible to his passion, are
proofs that <i>Tasso</i> was a true poet, and knew [how] to
touch those strings, with which our genuine feelings must
ever harmonize. In elegant and just description he is
equally to be admired. The scene in which <i>Tircis</i> describes
the lovely <i>Silvia</i> bound naked to a tree by a brutal
satyr, and released by <i>Amyntas</i>, whose passion she treated
with scorn, is one of the most beautiful pieces of poetic
painting. But, when <i>Amyntas</i>, unloosing his disdainful
mistress, addresses himself to the tree, to which she was
tied; when he declares its rugged trunk to be unworthy
of the bonds of that beautiful hair, which encircled it, and
reproaches its cruelty in tearing and disfiguring those
charming tresses, we laugh at such despicable conceits, and
lament that vicious taste, to which even a true poet found
himself (we presume against his better judgment) so often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span>
compelled to sacrifice. So likewise when, forgetting nature,
he resorts to the ordinary cant of pastoral, the language
and thoughts of <i>Theocritus</i> and <i>Virgil</i>, and even superadds
to those common-places, the false refinement, which in his
age delighted his countrymen, we turn with dissatisfaction
from his page. If we compare him, where the similarity
of the subject allows a comparison, with the Scotish poet,
how poor does the Italian appear in the competition!</p>

<p>Thus, let the first scene of the <i>Aminta</i>, between <i>Silvia</i>
and <i>Daphne</i>, be compared with the scene between <i>Jenny</i> and
<i>Peggy</i>, in the <i>Gentle Shepherd</i>. The subject of both is the
preference between a single and a married life:</p>

<p>By a similar strain of argument, <i>Linco</i>, in the <i>Pastor
Fido</i>, endeavours to persuade <i>Silvio</i> to love, whose sole delight
is in the chase, and who tells his adviser, that he
would not give one wild beast, taken by his dog <i>Melampo</i>,
for a thousand beautiful nymphs. <i>Linco</i> bids him "See
how all nature loves, the heavens, the earth, the sea; and
that beautiful morning star that now shines so bright, she
likewise loves, and shines more splendid from her amorous
flame: see how she blushes, for now perhaps she has just
left the stolen embraces of her lover. The woods, and all

describes to her copanion the delights of a mutual passion,
the enjoyments of domestic bliss, and the happiness arising
from the exercise of the parental duties and affections; contrasting
these with the cold and selfish feelings of determined

<p>Such are the sentiments of nature; nor is the language,
in which they are conveyed, inadequate to their force and
tenderness: for to those who understand the Scotish dialect,
the expression will be found to be as beautiful as the

artless descriptions, of which the heart instantly feels the

force, thus confessing their consonance to truth, that Ramsay
excels all the pastoral poets that ever wrote.</p>

<p>Thus <i>Patie</i> to <i>Peggy</i>, assuring her of the constancy of

<p>The charm of the <i>Gentle Shepherd</i> arises equally from the
nature of the passions, which are there delineated, and the
engaging simplicity and truth, with which their effects are
described. The poet paints an honourable and virtuous
affection between a youthful pair of the most amiable character;
a passion indulged on each side from the purest and
most disinterested motives, surmounting the severest of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span>
trials&mdash;the unexpected elevation of the lover to a rank
which, according to the maxims of the world, would preclude
the possibility of union; and crowned at length by the delightful
and most unlooked for discovery, that this union is
not only equal as to the condition of the parties, but is an
act of retributive justice. In the anxious suspense, that
precedes this discovery, the conflict of generous passions in
the breasts of the two lovers is drawn with consummate
art, and gives rise to a scene of the utmost tenderness, and
the most pathetic interest. Cold indeed must be that heart,
and dead to the finest sensibilities of our nature, which can
read without emotion the interview between <i>Patie</i> and
<i>Peggy</i>, after the discovery of <i>Patie's</i> elevated birth, which
the following lines describe:</p>

<p>The counsel, which <i>Patie</i> gives his friend, to prove with

<p>If, at times, we discern in the <i>Aminta</i> the proofs of a
knowledge of the human heart, and the simple and genuine
language of nature, our emotions of pleasure are soon
checked by some frivolous stroke of refinement, or some cold
conceit. In the <i>Pastor Fido</i>, the latter impression is entirely
predominant, and we are seldom gratified with any
thing like a natural or simple sentiment. The character of
<i>Silvio</i>, utterly insensible to the charms of beauty or of
female excellence, and who repays an ardent passion with
insolence and hatred, if it exists at all in nature, is fitted
only to excite contempt and detestation. <i>Dorinda's</i> courtship
of <i>Silvio</i> is equally nauseous, and the stratagem she
employs to gain his love is alike unnatural. She steals and
hides his favourite dog <i>Melampo</i>, and then throwing herself
in his way while he is whooping after him through the
forest, tells him she has found both the dog and a wounded
doe, and claims her reward for the discovery. "What shall
that be?" says <i>Silvio</i>.&mdash;"Only," replies the nymph, "one
of those things that your mother so often gives you."&mdash;"What,"
says he, "a box o' the ear?"&mdash;"Nay, nay, but,"
says Dorinda, "does she never give thee a kiss?"&mdash;"She
neither kisses me, nor wants that others should kiss me."&mdash;The
dog is produced, and <i>Silvio</i> asks, "Where is the doe?"&mdash;"That
poor doe," says she, "am I." A petulance which,
though rudely, we cannot say is unjustly punished, by Silvio
giving a thousand kisses to his dear dog, and leaving the
forward nymph, with a flat assurance of his hatred, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[lv]</a></span>
ruminate on his scorn, and her own indelicacy. If this is
nature, it is at least not <i>la belle nature</i>.</p>

<p>But the circumstance, on which turns the conversion of
the obdurate Silvio, bids defiance even to possibility. Hunting
in the forest, he holds a long discourse with an echo,
and is half persuaded, by the reflected sounds of his own
voice, that there is some real pleasure in love, and that he
himself must one day yield to its influence. Dorinda
clothes herself in the skin of a wolf, and is shot by him
with an arrow, mistaking her for that animal. Then all at
once he becomes her most passionate lover, sucks out the
barb of the arrow with a plaister of green herbs, and swears
to marry her on her recovery, which, by the favour of the
gods, is fortunately accomplished in an instant.</p>

<p>Equally unnatural with the fable are the sentiments of
this pastoral. <i>Amaryllis</i>, passionately adored by <i>Mirtillo</i>,
and secretly loving him, employs a long and refined metaphysical
argument to persuade him, that if he really loves
her, he ought to love her virtue; and that man's true glory
lies in curbing his appetites. The <i>moral</i> chorus seems to
have notions of love much more consonant to human nature,
who discourses for a quarter of an hour on the different
kinds of kisses, and the supreme pleasure felt, when they
are the expression of a mutual passion. But we need no
chorus to elucidate <i>arcana</i> of this nature.</p>

<p>True it is that in this drama, as in the <i>Aminta</i>, there
are passages of such transcendent beauty, of such high poetic
merit, that we cannot wonder if, to many readers, they
should veil every absurdity of fable, or of the general strain
of sentiment: for who is there that can read the apostrophe
of <i>Amaryllis</i> to the groves and woods, the eulogy of rural</p>

<p class="center medium">
Care selve beate, &amp;c.;<br />
</p>

<p>the charming address of <i>Mirtillo</i> to the spring&mdash;</p>

<p class="center medium">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</a></span></p>

<p>or the fanciful, but inspired description of the age of gold&mdash;</p>

<p class="center medium">
O bella età de l'oro! &amp;c.;<br />
</p>

<p>who is there that can read these passages without the
highest admiration and delight? but it must at the same
time be owned, that the merit of these Italian poets lies in
those highly finished, but thinly sown passages of splendour;
and not in the structure of their fables, or the consonance
of their general sentiments to truth and nature.</p>

<p>The principal difficulty in pastoral poetry, when it attempts
an actual delineation of nature, (which we have seen
is too seldom its object,) lies in the association of delicate
and affecting sentiments with the genuine manners of rustic
life; an union so difficult to be accomplished, that the chief
pastoral poets, both ancient and modern, have either entirely
abandoned the attempt, by choosing to paint a fabulous and
chimerical state of society; or have failed in their endeavour,
either by indulging in such refinement of sentiment as is
utterly inconsistent with rustic nature, or by endowing their
characters with such a rudeness and vulgarity of manners
as is hostile to every idea of delicacy. It appears to me
that <i>Ramsay</i> has most happily avoided these extremes; and
this he could the better do, from the singularly fortunate
choice of his subject. The principal persons of the drama,
though trained from infancy in the manners of rustic life,
are of generous birth; to whom therefore we may allow,
from nature and the influence of blood, an elevation of
sentiment, and a nobler mode of thinking, than to ordinary
peasants. To these characters the poet has therefore, with
perfect propriety and knowledge of human nature, given
the generous sentiments that accord with their condition,
though veiled a little by the manners, and conveyed in
the language which suits their accidental situation. The
other characters, who are truly peasants, are painted with
fidelity from nature; but even of these, the situation
chosen by the poet was favourable for avoiding that extreme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[lvii]</a></span>
vulgarity and coarseness of manners which would
have offended a good taste. The peasantry of the <i>Pentland
hills</i>, within six or seven miles of the metropolis,
with which of course they have frequent communication,
cannot be supposed to exhibit the same rudeness of manners
which distinguishes those of the remote part of the
country. As the models, therefore, from which the poet
drew were cast in a finer mould than mere provincial rustics,
so their copies, as drawn by him, do not offend by
their vulgarity, nor is there any greater degree of rusticity
than what merely distinguishes their mode of life
and occupations.</p>

<p>In what I have said of the manners of the characters
in the <i>Gentle Shepherd</i>, I know that I encounter the
prejudices of some <i>Scotish critics</i>, who allowing otherwise
the very high merits of Ramsay as a poet, and giving
him credit in particular for his knowledge of human nature,
and skill to touch the passions, quarrel with him only on
the score of his language; as they seem to annex inseparably
the idea of coarseness and vulgarity to every thing
that is written in the native dialect of their country: but
of this I have said enough before. To every Englishman,
and, I trust, to every Scotsman not of fastidious refinement,
the dialect of the <i>Gentle Shepherd</i> will appear to be most
perfectly consonant to the characters of the speakers, and
the times in which the action is laid. To this latter circumstance
the critics I have just mentioned seem not to
have been sufficiently attentive. The language of this pastoral
is not precisely the Scotish language of the present
day: the poet himself spoke the language of the beginning
of the century, and his persons were of the age preceding
that period. To us their dialect is an antiquated tongue,
and as such it carries with it a Doric simplicity. But
when we consider both the characters and the times, it
has an indispensable propriety; and to have given the
speakers in the <i>Gentle Shepherd</i> a more refined and pollished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</a></span>
dialect, or more modern tone of conversation, would
have been a gross violation of truth and nature.</p>

<p>In the faithful painting of rustic life, <i>Ramsay</i> seems to
have been indebted to his own situation and early habits,
as well as to the want of a learned education. He was
familiarly acquainted with rural nature from actual observation;
and his own impressions were not weakened or
altered by much acquaintance with the classical common-places,
or with those artificial pictures which are presented
by the poets.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> It is not therefore the general characters
of the country, which one poet can easily draw from the
works of others, that we find in his pastoral; it was the
country in which he lived, the genuine manners of its inhabitants,
the actual scenes with which he was conversant,
that fixed his observation, and guided his imitative pencil.
The character which, in the preface to his Evergreen, he
assigns to the Scotish poetry in general, is in the most
peculiar manner assignable to his own: "The morning rises
in the poet's description, as she does in the Scotish horizon:
we are not carried to Greece and Italy for a shade, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[lix]</a></span>
stream, or a breeze; the groves rise in our own valleys, the
rivers flow from our own fountains, and the winds blow
upon our own hills." Ramsay's landscapes are drawn with
the most characteristic precision: we view the scene before
us, as in the paintings of a <i>Claude</i> or a <i>Waterloo</i>; and the
hinds and shepherds of the Pentland hills, to all of whom
this delightful pastoral is as familiar as their catechism,
can trace the whole of its scenery in nature, and are eager
to point out to the inquiring stranger&mdash;the waterfall of
<i>Habbie's how</i>&mdash;the cottages of <i>Glaud</i> and <i>Symon</i>&mdash;<i>Sir William's
ancient tower</i>, ruinated in the civil wars, but since
rebuilt&mdash;the <i>auld avenue</i> and <i>shady groves</i>, still remaining
in defiance of the modern taste for naked, shadeless lawns.
And here let it be remarked, as perhaps the surest criterion
of the merit of this pastoral as a <i>true delineation of
nature</i>, that it is universally relished and admired by that
class of people whose habits of life and manners are there
described. Its sentiments and descriptions are in unison
with their feelings. It is recited, with congenial animation
and delight, at the fireside of the farmer, when in the
evening the lads and lasses assemble to solace themselves
after the labours of the day, and share the rustic meal.
There is not a milk-maid, a plough-boy, or a shepherd, of
the Lowlands of Scotland, who has not by heart its favourite
passages, and can rehearse its entire scenes. There
are many of its couplets that, like the verses of Homer,
are become proverbial, and have the force of an adage,
when introduced in familiar writing, or in ordinary conversation.</p>

<p class="medium">"The sentiments of [the 'Gentle Shepherd'], are natural,
the circumstances interesting; the characters well drawn,
well distinguished, and well contrasted; and the fable has
more probability than any other pastoral drama I am acquainted
with. To an Englishman who has never conversed
with the common people of Scotland, the language would
appear only antiquated, obscure, or unintelligible; but to a
Scotchman who thoroughly understands it, and is aware of
its vulgarity, it appears <i>ludicrous</i>; from the contrast between
<i>meanness</i> of phrase and <i>dignity</i> or <i>seriousness</i> of sentiment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[lxii]</a></span></p>

<p class="medium">This gives a farcical air even to the most affecting part of
the <i>poem</i>; and occasions an impropriety of a peculiar kind,
which is very observable in the representation. And accordingly,
this play, with all its merit, and with a strong

<p class="medium">"<i>Ramsay</i> was a man of strong natural, though few acquired
parts, possessed of much humour, and native poetic
fancy. Born in a pastoral country, he had strongly imbibed
the manners and humours of that life. As I knew him
well, an honest man, and of great pleasantry, it is with
peculiar satisfaction I seize this opportunity of doing justice
to his memory, in giving testimony to his being the author
of the <i>Gentle Shepherd</i>, which, for the natural ease of the
dialogue, the propriety of the characters, perfectly similar to
the pastoral life in Scotland, the picturesque scenery, and,
above all, the simplicity and beauty of the fable, may justly
rank amongst the most eminent pastoral dramas that our
own or any other nation can boast of. Merit will ever be
followed by detraction. The envious tale, that the <i>Gentle
Shepherd</i> was the joint composition of some wits with whom
<i>Ramsay</i> conversed, is without truth. It might be sufficient
to say, that none of these gentlemen have left the mediumest
fragment behind them that can give countenance to such a
claim. While I passed my infancy at <i>Newhall</i>, near <i>Pentland
hills</i>, where the scenes of this pastoral poem are laid,
the seat of Mr. <i>Forbes</i>, and the resort of many of the <i>literati</i>
at that time, I well remember to have heard <i>Ramsay</i> recite,
as his own production, different scenes of the <i>Gentle
Shepherd</i>, particularly the first two, before it was printed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[lxiii]</a></span>
I believe my honourable friend Sir <i>James Clerk of Pennycuik</i>,
where <i>Ramsay</i> frequently resided, and who I know
is possessed of several original poems composed by him,
can give the same testimony."</p>

<p class="medium">"I must not omit the mention of another <i>pastoral drama</i>,
which will bear being brought into comparison with any
composition of this kind, in any language; that is, Allan
Ramsay's Gentle Shepherd. It is a great disadvantage to
this beautiful poem, that it is written in the old rustic
dialect of Scotland, which, in a short time, will probably
be entirely obsolete, and not intelligible; and it is a farther
disadvantage that it is so entirely formed on the rural
manners of Scotland, that none but a native of that country
can thoroughly understand or relish it. But, though subject
to these local disadvantages, which confine its reputation
within narrow limits, it is full of so much natural
description, and tender sentiment, as would do honour to
any poet. The characters are well drawn, the incidents
affecting; the scenery and manners lively and just. It
affords a strong proof, both of the power which nature and
simplicity possess, to reach the heart in every sort of
writing; and of the variety of pleasing characters and subjects
with which <i>pastoral poetry</i>, when properly managed,
is capable of being enlivened."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">John Pinkerton.</span> 1786.</p>

<p class="medium">"<span class="smcap">Allan Ramsay.</span> The convivial buffoonery of this writer
has acquired him a sort of reputation, which his poetry
by no means warrants; being far beneath the middling,
and showing no spark of genius. Even his buffoonery is
not that of a tavern, but that of an ale-house.</p>

<p class="medium">"The <i>Gentle Shepherd</i> all now allow the sole foundation
of his fame. Let us put it in the furnace a little; for, if
it be gold, it will come out the purer. Dr. Beattie, in his
Essay on Laughter and Ludicrous Composition, observes,
that the effect of the Gentle Shepherd is ludicrous from
the contrast between meanness of phrase, and dignity or
seriousness of sentiment. This is not owing to its being
written in the Scotish dialect, now left to the peasantry,
as that ingenious writer thinks; for the first part of Hardyknute,
written in that very dialect, strikes every English
reader as sublime and pathetic to the highest degree. In
fact this glaring defect proceeds from Allan Ramsay's own
character as a buffoon, so evident from all his poems, and
which we all know he bore in private life; and from Allan's
total ignorance of the Scotish tongue, save that spoken
by the mob of Mid Lothian. It is well known that a
comic actor of the Shuter or Edwin class, though highly
meritorious in his line, yet, were he to appear in any save
<i>queer</i> characters, the effect would even be more ludicrous
than when he was in his proper parts, from the contrast of
the man with his assumed character. This applies also to
authors; for Sterne's sermons made us laugh, though there
was nothing laughable in them: and, had Rabelais, or
Sterne, written a pastoral opera, though the reader had been
ignorant of their characters, still a something, a je ne sçai
quoi, in the phraseology, would have ever provoked laughter.
But this effect Ramsay has even pushed further; for, by his
entire ignorance of the Scotish tongue, save that spoken by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[lxv]</a></span>
the mob around him, he was forced to use the very phraseology
of the merest vulgar, rendered yet more ridiculous
by his own turn to low humour; being himself indeed one
of the mob, both in education and in mind. So that putting
such <i>queer</i> language into the mouth of respectable characters&mdash;nay,
pretending to clothe sentiments, pathos, and all that,
with such phraseology&mdash;his whole Gentle Shepherd has the
same effect as a gentleman would have who chose to drive
sheep on the highway with a harlequin's coat on. This
radical defect at once throws the piece quite out of the class
of good compositions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="medium">"Allan was indeed so much a <i>poet</i>, that in his <i>Evergreen</i>
he even puts rhyming titles to the old poems he publishes;
and by this silly idea, and his own low character,
has stamped a kind of ludicrous hue on the old Scotish
poetry, of which he pretended to be a publisher, that even
now is hardly eradicated, though many editors of great
learning and high respectability have arisen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="medium">"I have been the fuller on this subject, because, to the
great discredit of taste in Scotland, while we admire the
effusions of this scribbler, we utterly neglect our really great
poets, such as Barbour, Dunbar, Drummond, &amp;c. There is
even a sort of national prejudice in favour of the Gentle
Shepherd, because it is our only drama in the Scotish language;
yet we ought to be ashamed to hold prejudices so
ridiculous to other nations, and so obnoxious to taste, and
just criticism. I glory in Scotland as my native country;
and, while I try to root up all other prejudices out of my
mind, shall ever nourish my partiality to my country; as,
if that be a prejudice, it has been esteemed an honest and
a laudable one in all ages; and is, indeed, the only prejudice
perfectly consonant to reason, and vindicable by
truth. But Scotland has no occasion to recur to false history,
false taste, false science, or false honours of any kind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[lxvi]</a></span>
In the severest light of truth she will stand very conspicuous.
Her sons, in trying to adorn her, have shown
remarkable defects of judgment. The ancient history of the
Picts, so splendid in the page of Tacitus, is lost in our own
fables. We neglect all our great poets, and are in raptures
with Allan Ramsay. Our prejudices are as pitiful as strong;
and we know not that the truth would make us far more
illustrious, than all our dreams of prejudice, if <i>realized</i>, to
use an expression of impossibility. Good sense in antiquities,
and good taste in poetry, are astonishingly wanting
in Scotland to this hour."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

though some of his songs may be deformed by far-fetched

<p class="medium">"Whether the dialect of Scotland be more favourable to
attempts of this nature, or whether we are to seek for the
fact in the character of the people, or the peculiar talents
of the writers, certain it is, that the idiom of that country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[lxvii]</a></span>
has been much more successfully employed in poetical composition,
than that of any other part of these kingdoms,
and that this practice may here be traced to a very early
period. In later times the beautiful <i>dramatic poem</i> of The
Gentle Shepherd has exhibited rusticity without vulgarity,
and elegant sentiment without affectation. Like the heroes
of Homer, the characters of this piece can engage in the
humblest occupations without degradation."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thomas Campbell.</span> 1819.</p>

<p class="medium">"The admirers of the Gentle Shepherd, must perhaps be
contented to share some suspicion of national partiality,
while they do justice to their own feeling of its merit.
Yet as this drama is a picture of rustic Scotland, it would
perhaps be saying little for its fidelity, if it yielded no more
agreeableness to the breast of a native than he could expound
to a stranger by the strict letter of criticism. We
should think the painter had finished the likeness of a
mother very indifferently, if it did not bring home to her
children traits of undefinable expression which had escaped
every eye but that of familiar affection. Ramsay had not
the force of Burns; but, neither, in just proportion to his
merits, is he likely to be felt by an English reader. The
fire of Burns' wit and passion glows through an obscure
dialect by its confinement to short and concentrated bursts.
The interest which Ramsay excites is spread over a long
poem, delineating manners more than passions; and the
mind must be at home both in the language and manners,
to appreciate the skill and comic archness with which he
has heightened the display of rustic character without giving
it vulgarity, and refined the view of peasant life by situations
of sweetness and tenderness, without departing in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[lxviii]</a></span>
least degree from its simplicity. The Gentle Shepherd stands
quite apart from the general pastoral poetry of modern Europe.
It has no satyrs, nor featureless simpletons, nor
drowsy and still landscapes of nature, but distinct characters
and amusing incidents. The principal shepherd never speaks
out of consistency with the habits of a peasant, but he
moves in that sphere with such a manly spirit, with so
much cheerful sensibility to its humble joys, with maxims
of life so rational and independent, and with an ascendency
over his fellow swains so well maintained by his force of
character, that if we could suppose the pacific scenes of the
drama to be suddenly changed into situations of trouble and
danger, we should, in exact consistency with our former idea
of him, expect him to become the leader of the peasants,
and the Tell of his native hamlet. Nor is the character of
his mistress less beautifully conceived. She is represented,
like himself, as elevated, by a fortunate discovery, from
obscure to opulent life, yet as equally capable of being the
ornament of either. A Richardson or a D'Arblay, had they
continued her history, might have heightened the portrait,
but they would not have altered its outline. Like the
poetry of Tasso and Ariosto, that of the Gentle Shepherd is
engraven on the memory of its native country. Its verses
have passed into proverbs and it continues to be the delight
and solace of the peasantry whom it describes."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Leigh Hunt.</span> 1848.</p>

<p class="medium">"Poetical expression in humble life is to be found all
over the south. In the instances of Burns, Ramsay, and
others, the north also has seen it. Indeed, it is not a little
remarkable, that Scotland, which is more northern than England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[lxix]</a></span>
and possesses not even a nightingale, has had more
of it than its southern neighbour."</p>

<p class="medium">"Allan Ramsay is the prince of the homely pastoral
drama. He and Burns have helped Scotland for ever to
take pride in its heather, and its braes, and its bonny rivers,
and be ashamed of no honest truth in high estate or in
low; an incalculable blessing. Ramsay is entitled not only
to the designation we have given him, but in some respects
is the best pastoral writer in the world. There are, in
truth, two sorts of genuine pastoral&mdash;the high ideal of
Fletcher and Milton, which is justly to be considered the
more poetical,&mdash;and the homely ideal, as set forth by Allan
Ramsay and some of the Idyls of Theocritus, and which
gives us such feelings of nature and passion as poetical
rustics not only can, but have entertained and eloquently
described. And we think the Gentle Shepherd, 'in some
respects,' the best pastoral that ever was written, not because
it has anything, in a poetical point of view, to compare
with Fletcher and Milton, but because there is, upon
the whole, more faith and more love in it, and because the
kind of idealized truth which it undertakes to represent, is
delivered in a more corresponding and satisfactory form than
in any other entire pastoral drama. In fact, the Gentle
Shepherd has no alloy whatsoever to its pretensions, <i>such
as they are</i>&mdash;no failure in plot, language, or character&mdash;nothing
answering to the coldness and irrelevances of 'Comus,'
nor to the offensive and untrue violations of decorum in the
'Wanton Shepherdess' of Fletcher's pastoral, and the pedantic
and ostentatious chastity of his Faithful one. It is
a pure, healthy, natural, and (of its kind) perfect plant,
sprung out of an unluxuriant but not ungenial soil; not
hung with the beauty and fragrance of the productions of
the higher regions of Parnassus; not waited upon by spirits
and enchanted music; a dog-rose, if you will; say rather, a
rose in a cottage-garden, dabbled with the morning dew,
and plucked by an honest lover to give to his mistress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[lxx]</a></span>
</p>

<p class="medium">"Allan Ramsay's poem is not only a probable and
pleasing story, containing charming pictures, much knowledge
of life, and a good deal of quiet humour, but in some
respects it may be called classical, if by classical is meant
ease, precision, and unsuperfluousness of style. Ramsay's
diction is singularly straightforward, seldom needing the assistance
of inversions; and he rarely says anything for the
purpose of 'filling up;'&mdash;two freedoms from defect the reverse
of vulgar and commonplace; nay, the reverse of a great
deal of what pretends to be fine writing, and is received
as such. We confess we never tire of dipping into it, 'on
and off,' any more than into Fletcher or Milton, or into
Theocritus himself, who, for the union of something higher
with true pastoral, is unrivalled in short pieces. The Gentle
Shepherd is not a forest, nor a mountain-side, nor
Arcady; but it is a field full of daisies, with a brook in
it, and a cottage 'at the sunny end;' and this we take to
be no mean thing, either in the real or the ideal world.
Our Jar of Honey may well lie for a few moments among
its heather, albeit filled with Hybla. There are bees, 'look
you,' in Habbie's How. Theocritus and Allan shake hands
over a shepherd's pipe. Take the beginning of Scene ii.,
Act i., both for description and dialogue:&mdash;</p>

pastorals put together, and (we were going to add) half of
those of Virgil; but we reverence too much the great follower
of the Greeks, and true lover of the country. There
is more sentiment, and equal nature, in the song at the end

<p class="medium">The highest refinement of the heart, though too rare in
most classes, is luckily to be found in all; and hence it is,
that certain meetings of extremes in lovers of different ranks
in life are not always to be attributed either to a failure of
taste on the one side, or unsuitable pretensions on the other.
Scotish dukes have been known to meet with real Gentle-Shepherd
heroines; and everybody knows the story of a
lowly Countess of Exeter, who was too sensitive to survive
the disclosure of the rank to which her lover had raised
her."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p class="center large p4"><span class="smcap">Anecdote of Lady Strange.</span></p>


<p class="p2">During nearly twenty years of the latter part of Ramsay's
life, "he continued occasionally to write epistles in
verse, and other short pieces, as he had done before, for the
entertainment of his private friends. When urged by some
of them to give some more of his works to the press, he
said that he was more inclined, if it were in his power, to
recall much of what he had already written, and that if
half his printed books were burnt, the other half, like the
Sybil's books, would become more valuable by it."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Still
more deeply was this feeling entertained by his son, who
hesitated not to express it in a manner more emphatic than
respectful to his father's memory. On one occasion, in London,
and in the house of Lady Strange, widow of the celebrated
engraver of that name&mdash;a lady whose kindness to
her countrymen and predilection for Scotland will long be
remembered&mdash;he is said to have declared that if he could
purchase every copy of his father's writings, even at the
cost of a thousand pounds, he would commit them to the
flames. "Indeed, sir," replied the lady, misunderstanding
his meaning, "then let me tell you that if you could, and
should do so, your labour would be lost, for I can," says
she, "repeat from memory <i>every word</i> of the Gentle Shepherd,
and were you to consume every copy of it, I would
write out that matchless poem with my own hand, and
cause it to be printed at my own charges."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>

<p class="center medium p2">THE RIGHT HONOURABLE</p>
<p class="center xlarge p2">SUSANNA,</p>
<p class="center medium p2"><i>COUNTESS OF EGLINTOUN</i>.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>
<hr class="chap" />
<p>
<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>
The love of approbation, and a desire to please the
best, have ever encouraged the Poets to finish their designs
with chearfulness. But, conscious of their own
inability to oppose a storm of spleen and haughty ill-nature,
it is generally an ingenious custom amongst them
to chuse some honourable shade.
</p>
<p>
Wherefore, I beg leave to put my Pastoral under
your Ladyship's protection. If my Patroness says, the
Shepherds speak as they ought, and that there are several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_two" id="Page_two">[ii]</a></span>
natural flowers that beautify the rural wild, I shall
have good reason to think myself safe from the awkward
censure of some pretending judges that condemn before
examination.
</p>

<p>
I am sure of vast numbers that will crowd into your
Ladyship's opinion, and think it their honour to agree
in their sentiments with the Countess of <span class="smcap">Eglintoun</span>,
whose penetration, superior wit, and sound judgment,
shines with an uncommon lustre, while accompanied
with the diviner charms of goodness and equality of
mind.
</p>
<p>
If it were not for offending only your Ladyship, here,
Madam, I might give the fullest liberty to my muse to
delineate the finest of women, by drawing your Ladyship's
character, and be in no hazard of being deemed a
flatterer; since flattery lyes not in paying what's due to
merit, but in praises misplaced.
</p>
<p>
Were I to begin with your Ladyship's honourable
birth and alliance, the field's ample, and presents us
with numberless great and good Patriots that have dignified
the names of <span class="smcap">Kennedy</span> and <span class="smcap">Montgomery</span>: Be that
the care of the herauld and historian. 'Tis personal
merit, and the heavenly sweetness of the fair, that inspire
the tuneful lays. Here every Lesbia must be
excepted, whose tongues give liberty to the slaves,
which their eyes had made captives. Such may be flatter'd;
but your Ladyship justly claims our admiration
and profoundest respect: for, whilst you are possest of
every outward charm in the most perfect degree, the
never-fading beauties of wisdom and piety, which adorn
your Ladyship's mind, command devotion.
</p>
<p>
"All this is very true," cries one of better sense
than good nature, "but what occasion have you to tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_three" id="Page_three">[iii]</a></span>
us the sun shines, when we have the use of our eyes,
and feel his influence?"&mdash;Very true; but I have the
liberty to use the Poet's privilege, which is, "To speak
what every body thinks." Indeed, there might be some
strength in the reflection, if the Idalian registers were
of as short duration as life: but the bard, who fondly
hopes immortality, has a certain praise-worthy pleasure
in communicating to posterity the fame of distinguished
characters.&mdash;&mdash;I write this last sentence with a hand that
trembles between hope and fear: But if I shall prove
so happy as to please your Ladyship in the following
attempt, then all my doubts shall vanish like a morning
vapour:&mdash;I shall hope to be classed with Tasso and
Guarini, and sing with Ovid,

<table summary="iv">
<tr>
<td class="tdl"><span class="i2"><span class="smcap">Accept, O Eglintoun!</span> the rural lays,</span><br />
That, bound to thee, thy duteous Poet pays!<br />
The muse, that oft has rais'd her tuneful strains,<br />
A frequent guest on <span class="smcap">Scotia's</span> blissful plains,<br />
That oft has sung, her list'ning youth to move,<br />
The charms of beauty and the force of love,<br />
Once more resumes the still successful lay,<br />
Delighted, thro' the verdant meads to stray.<br />
O! come, invok'd, and pleas'd, with Her repair,<br />
To breathe the balmy sweets of purer air,<br />
In the cool evening negligently laid,<br />
Or near the stream, or in the rural shade,<br />
Propitious hear, and, as thou hear'st, approve<br />
The <span class="smcap">Gentle Shepherd's</span> tender tale of love.<br />
<span class="i2">Instructed from these scenes, what glowing fires</span><br />
Inflame the breast that real love inspires!<br />
The fair shall read of ardours, sighs, and tears,<br />
All that a lover hopes, and all he fears:<br />
Hence, too, what passions in his bosom rise!<br />
What dawning gladness sparkles in his eyes!<br />
When first the fair one, piteous of his fate,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_five" id="Page_five">[v]</a></span>
Cur'd of her scorn, and vanquish'd of her hate,<br />
With willing mind, is bounteous to relent,<br />
And blushing, beauteous, smiles the kind consent!<br />
Love's passion here in each extreme is shown,<br />
In Charlot's smile, or in Maria's frown.<br />
<span class="i2">With words like these, that fail'd not to engage,</span><br />
Love courted beauty in a golden age,<br />
Pure and untaught, such nature first inspir'd,<br />
Ere yet the fair affected phrase desir'd.<br />
His secret thoughts were undisguis'd with art,<br />
His words ne'er knew to differ from his heart:<br />
He speaks his love so artless and sincere,<br />
As thy Eliza might be pleas'd to hear.<br />
<span class="i2">Heaven only to the Rural State bestows</span><br />
Conquest o'er life, and freedom from its woes:<br />
Secure alike from Envy and from Care;<br />
Nor rais'd by Hope, nor yet depress'd by Fear:<br />
Nor Want's lean hand its happiness constrains,<br />
Nor Riches torture with ill-gotten gains.<br />
No secret Guilt its stedfast peace destroys,<br />
No wild Ambition interrupts its joys.<br />
Blest still to spend the hours that Heav'n has lent<br />
In humble goodness, and in calm content:<br />
Serenely gentle, as the thoughts that roll,<br />
Sinless and pure, in fair Humeia's soul.<br />
<span class="i2">But now the Rural State these joys has lost;</span><br />
Even swains no more that innocence can boast:<br />
Love speaks no more what beauty may believe,<br />
Prone to betray, and practis'd to deceive.<br />
Now happiness forsakes her blest retreat,<br />
The peaceful dwellings where she fix'd her seat;<br />
The pleasing fields she wont of old to grace,<br />
Companion to an upright sober race;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_six" id="Page_six">[vi]</a></span>
When on the sunny hill, or verdant plain,<br />
Free and familiar with the sons of men,<br />
To crown the pleasures of the blameless feast,<br />
She uninvited came a welcome guest;<br />
Ere yet an age, grown rich in impious arts,<br />
Brib'd from their innocence incautious hearts:<br />
Then grudging hate, and sinful pride succeed,<br />
Cruel revenge, and false unrighteous deed;<br />
Then dow'rless beauty lost the power to move;<br />
The rust of lucre stain'd the gold of love:<br />
Bounteous no more, and hospitably good,<br />
The genial hearth first blush'd with stranger's blood:<br />
The friend no more upon the friend relies,<br />
And semblant falsehood puts on truth's disguise:<br />
The peaceful houshold fill'd with dire alarms;<br />
The ravish'd virgin mourns her slighted charms:<br />
The voice of impious mirth is heard around;<br />
In guilt they feast, in guilt the bowl is crowned:<br />
Unpunish'd violence lords it o'er the plains,<br />
And Happiness forsakes the guilty swains.<br />
<span class="i2">Oh Happiness! from human search retir'd,</span><br />
Where art thou to be found, by all desir'd?<br />
Nun, sober and devout! why art thou fled,<br />
To hide in shades thy meek contented head?<br />
Virgin of aspect mild! ah! why, unkind,<br />
Fly'st thou, displeas'd, the commerce of mankind?<br />
O! teach our steps to find the secret cell,<br />
Where, with thy sire, Content, thou lov'st to dwell.<br />
Or say, dost thou, a duteous handmaid, wait<br />
Familiar at the chambers of the great?<br />
Dost thou pursue the voice of them that call<br />
To noisy revel, and to midnight ball?<br />
O'er the full banquet when we feast our soul,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_seven" id="Page_seven">[vii]</a></span>
Dost thou inspire the mirth, or mix the bowl?<br />
Or, with th' industrious planter dost thou talk,<br />
Conversing freely in an evening walk?<br />
Say, does the miser e'er thy face behold,<br />
Watchful and studious of the treasur'd gold?<br />
Seeks Knowledge, not in vain, thy much lov'd pow'r,<br />
Still musing silent at the morning hour?<br />
May we thy presence hope in war's alarms,<br />
The Statesman's wisdom, or the Fair-one's charms?<br />
<span class="i2">In vain our flatt'ring hopes our steps beguile,</span><br />
The flying good eludes the searcher's toil:<br />
In vain we seek the city or the cell,<br />
Alone with Virtue knows the Pow'r to dwell.<br />
Nor need mankind despair these joys to know,<br />
The gift themselves may on themselves bestow.<br />
Soon, soon we might the precious blessing boast,<br />
But many passions must the blessing cost;<br />
Infernal Malice, inly pining Hate,<br />
And Envy, grieving at another's state:<br />
Revenge no more must in our hearts remain,<br />
Or burning Lust, or Avarice of gain.<br />
When these are in the human bosom nurst,<br />
Can Peace reside in dwellings so accurst?<br />
Unlike, O <span class="smcap">Eglintoun</span>! thy happy breast,<br />
Calm and serene enjoys the heavenly guest;<br />
From the tumultuous rule of passions free'd,<br />
Pure in thy thought, and spotless in thy deed:<br />
In virtues rich, in goodness unconfin'd,<br />
Thou shin'st a fair example to thy kind;<br />
Sincere and equal to thy neighbour's fame,<br />
How swift to praise, but how averse to blame!<br />
Bold in thy presence bashful Sense appears,<br />
And backward Merit loses all its fears.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_eight" id="Page_eight">[viii]</a></span>
Supremely blest by Heav'n, Heav'n's richest grace,<br />
Confest is thine, an early blooming race;<br />
Whose pleasing smiles shall guardian Wisdom arm,<br />
Divine Instruction! taught of thee to charm:<br />
What transports shall they to thy soul impart,<br />
(The conscious transports of a parent's heart)<br />
When thou behold'st them of each grace possest,<br />
And sighing youths imploring to be blest!<br />
After thy image form'd, with charms like thine,<br />
Or in the visit, or the dance to shine:<br />
Thrice happy! who succeed their mother's praise,<br />
The lovely <span class="smcap">Eglintouns</span> of future days.<br />
<span class="i2">Meanwhile peruse the following tender scenes,</span><br />
And listen to thy native Poet's strains:<br />
In ancient garb the home-bred muse appears,<br />
The garb our Muses wore in former years:<br />
As in a glass reflected, here behold<br />
How smiling goodness look'd in days of old:<br />
Nor blush to read where beauty's praise is shown,<br />
And virtuous love, the likeness of thy own;<br />
While, 'midst the various gifts that gracious Heaven,<br />
Bounteous to thee, with righteous hand has given,<br />
Let this, O <span class="smcap">Eglintoun</span>! delight thee most,<br />
T' enjoy that Innocence the world has lost.</td>

This sunny morning, Roger, chears my blood,<br />
And puts all nature in a jovial mood.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
How heartsome 'tis to see the rising plants!<br />
To hear the birds chirm o'er their pleasing rants!<br />
How halesome 'tis to snuff the cauler air,<br />
And all the sweets it bears, when void of care!<br />
What ails thee, Roger, then? what gars thee grane?<br />
Tell me the cause of thy ill-season'd pain.<br />
<br />
<i>Rog.</i> I'm born, O Patie! to a thrawart fate;<br />
I'm born to strive with hardships sad and great.<br />
Tempests may cease to jaw the rowan flood,<br />
Corbies and tods to grein for lambkins blood;<br />
But I, opprest with never ending grief,<br />
Maun ay despair of lighting on relief.<br />
<br />
<i>Pat.</i> The bees shall loath the flower, and quit the hive,<br />
The saughs on boggie-ground shall cease to thrive,<br />
Ere scornful queans, or loss of warldly gear,<br />
Shall spill my rest, or ever force a tear.<br />
<br />
<i>Rog.</i> Sae might I say; but 'tis no easy done<br />
By ane whase saul is sadly out of tune.<br />
You have sae saft a voice, and slid a tongue,<br />
You are the darling of baith auld and young.<br />
If I but ettle at a sang, or speak,<br />
They dit their lugs, syne up their leglens cleek;<br />
And jeer me hameward frae the loan or bught,<br />
While I'm confus'd with mony a vexing thought;<br />
Yet I am tall, and as well built as thee,<br />
Nor mair unlikely to a lass's e'e.<br />
For ilka sheep ye have, I'll number ten,<br />
And should, as ane may think, come farer ben.<br />
<br />
<i>Pat.</i> But ablins, nibour, ye have not a heart,<br />
And downa eithly wi' your cunzie part.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
If that be true, what signifies your gear?<br />
A mind that's scrimpit never wants some care.<br />
<br />
<i>Rog.</i> My byar tumbled, nine braw nowt were smoor'd,<br />
Three elf-shot were; yet I these ills endur'd:<br />
In winter last, my cares were very sma',<br />
Tho' scores of wathers perish'd in the snaw.<br />
<br />
<i>Pat.</i> Were your bein rooms as thinly stock'd as mine,<br />
Less you wad lose, and less you wad repine.<br />
He that has just enough, can soundly sleep;<br />
The o'ercome only fashes fowk to keep.<br />
<br />
<i>Rog.</i> May plenty flow upon thee for a cross,<br />
That thou may'st thole the pangs of mony a loss.<br />
O may'st thou doat on some fair paughty wench,<br />
That ne'er will lout thy lowan drouth to quench,<br />
'Till bris'd beneath the burden, thou cry dool,<br />
And awn that ane may fret that is nae fool.<br />
<br />
<i>Pat.</i> Sax good fat lambs I said them ilka clute<br />
At the West-Port, and bought a winsome flute,<br />
Of plum-tree made, with iv'ry virles round;<br />
A dainty whistle, with a pleasant sound:<br />
I'll be mair canty wi't, and ne'er cry dool,<br />
Than you with all your cash, ye dowie fool!<br />
<br />
<i>Rog.</i> Na, Patie, na! I'm nae sic churlish beast,<br />
Some other thing lyes heavier at my breast:<br />
I dream'd a dreary dream this hinder night,<br />
That gars my flesh a' creep yet with the fright.<br />
<br />
<i>Pat.</i> Now, to a friend, how silly's this pretence,<br />
To ane wha you and a' your secrets kens:<br />
Daft are your dreams, as daftly wad ye hide<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Your well seen love, and dorty Jenny's pride.<br />
Take courage, Roger, me your sorrows tell,<br />
And safely think nane kens them but your sell.<br />
<br />
<i>Rog.</i> Indeed now, Patie, ye have guess'd o'er true,<br />
And there is naething I'll keep up frae you:<br />
Me dorty Jenny looks upon a-squint;<br />
To speak but till her I dare hardly mint:<br />
In ilka place she jeers me air and late,<br />
And gars me look bumbaz'd, and unko blate:<br />
But yesterday I met her 'yont a know,<br />
She fled as frae a shellycoat or kow.<br />
She Bauldy loes, Bauldy that drives the car;<br />
But gecks at me, and says I smell of tar.<br />
<br />
<i>Pat.</i> But Bauldy loes not her, right well I wat;<br />
He sighs for Neps&mdash;sae that may stand for that.<br />
<br />
<i>Rog.</i> I wish I cou'dna loo her&mdash;but in vain,<br />
I still maun doat, and thole her proud disdain.<br />
My Bawty is a cur I dearly like,<br />
Even while he fawn'd, she strak the poor dumb tyke:<br />
If I had fill'd a nook within her breast,<br />
She wad have shawn mair kindness to my beast.<br />
When I begin to tune my stock and horn,<br />
With a' her face she shaws a caulrife scorn.<br />
Last night I play'd, ye never heard sic spite,<br />
<i>O'er Bogie</i> was the spring, and her delyte;<br />
Yet tauntingly she at her cousin speer'd,<br />
Gif she could tell what tune I play'd, and sneer'd.<br />
Flocks, wander where ye like, I dinna care,<br />
I'll break my reed, and never whistle mair.<br />
<br />
<i>Pat.</i> E'en do sae, Roger, wha can help misluck,<br />
Saebeins she be sic a thrawn-gabet chuck?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Yonder's a craig, since ye have tint all hope,<br />
Gae till't your ways, and take the lover's lowp.<br />

<i>Rog.</i> I needna mak' sic speed my blood to spill,<br />
I'll warrant death come soon enough a will.<br />
<br />
<i>Pat.</i> Daft gowk! leave off that silly whindging way;<br />
Seem careless, there's my hand ye'll win the day.<br />
Hear how I serv'd my lass I love as well<br />
As ye do Jenny, and with heart as leel:<br />
Last morning I was gay and early out,<br />
Upon a dike I lean'd glowring about,<br />
I saw my Meg come linkan o'er the lee;<br />
I saw my Meg, but Meggy saw na me:<br />
For yet the sun was wading thro' the mist,<br />
And she was closs upon me ere she wist;<br />
Her coats were kiltit, and did sweetly shaw<br />
Her straight bare legs that whiter were than snaw;<br />
Her cockernony snooded up fou sleek,<br />
Her haffet-locks hang waving on her cheek;<br />
Her cheek sae ruddy, and her een sae clear;<br />
And O! her mouth's like ony hinny pear.<br />
Neat, neat she was, in bustine waste-coat clean,<br />
As she came skiffing o'er the dewy green.<br />
Blythsome, I cry'd, My bonny Meg, come here,<br />
I ferly wherefore ye're sae soon asteer;<br />
But I can guess, ye'er gawn to gather dew:<br />
She scour'd awa, and said, <i>What's that to you?</i><br />
Then fare ye well, Meg Dorts, and e'en's ye like,<br />
I careless cry'd, and lap in o'er the dike.<br />
I trow, when that she saw, within a crack,<br />
She came with a right thievless errand back;<br />
Misca'd me first,&mdash;then bade me hound my dog<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
To wear up three waff ews stray'd on the bog.<br />
I leugh, and sae did she; then with great haste<br />
I clasp'd my arms about her neck and waste,<br />
About her yielding waste, and took a fouth<br />
Of sweetest kisses frae her glowing mouth.<br />
While hard and fast I held her in my grips,<br />
My very saul came lowping to my lips.<br />
Sair, sair she flet wi' me 'tween ilka smack;<br />
But well I kent she meant nae as she spake.<br />
Dear Roger, when your jo puts on her gloom,<br />
Do ye sae too, and never fash your thumb.<br />
Seem to forsake her, soon she'll change her mood;<br />
Gae woo anither, and she'll gang clean wood.</td>

There's some men constanter in love than we:<br />
Nor is the ferly great, when nature kind<br />
Has blest them with solidity of mind.<br />
They'll reason calmly, and with kindness smile,<br />

Then I'll employ with pleasure a' my art<br />
To keep him chearfu', and secure his heart.<br />
At even, when he comes weary frae the hill,<br />
I'll have a' things made ready to his will.<br />
In winter, when he toils thro' wind and rain,<br />
A bleezing ingle, and a clean hearth-stane.<br />
And soon as he flings by his plaid and staff,<br />
The seething pot's be ready to take aff.<br />
Clean hagabag I'll spread upon his board,<br />
And serve him with the best we can afford.<br />
Good humour and white bigonets shall be<br />
Guards to my face, to keep his love for me.<br />
<br />
<i>Jen.</i> A dish of married love right soon grows cauld,<br />
And dosens down to nane, as fowk grow auld.<br />
<br />
<i>Peg.</i> But we'll grow auld togither, and ne'er find<br />
The loss of youth, when love grows on the mind.<br />
Bairns, and their bairns, make sure a firmer ty,<br />
Than ought in love the like of us can spy.<br />
See yon twa elms that grow up side by side,<br />
Suppose them, some years syne, bridegroom and bride;<br />
Nearer and nearer ilka year they've prest, }<br />
'Till wide their spreading branches are increast, }<br />
And in their mixture now are fully blest. }<br />
This shields the other frae the eastlin blast,<br />

Beneath ilk storm, frae every airth, maun bow.<br />

To bear a leglen was nae toil to me,<br />
When at the bught at e'en I met with thee.<br />

<i>Pat.</i> When corns grew yellow, and the hether-bells<br />
Bloom'd bonny on the moor and rising fells,<br />
Nae birns, or briers, or whins e'er troubled me,<br />

<br />
<i>Peg.</i> When thou didst wrestle, run, or putt the stane,<br />
And wan the day, my heart was flightering fain:<br />
At all these sports thou still gave joy to me;<br />
For nane can wrestle, run, or putt with thee.<br />

At turns in <i>Maggy Lauder</i> Marion dings:<br />
But when my Peggy sings, with sweeter skill,<br />
The <i>Boat-man</i>, or the <i>Lass of Patie's Mill</i>;<br />
It is a thousand times mair sweet to me:<br />
Tho' they sing well, they canna sing like thee.<br />
<br />
<i>Peg.</i> How eith can lasses trow what they desire!<br />
And roos'd by them we love, blaws up that fire:<br />
But wha loves best, let time and carriage try;<br />
Be constant, and my love shall time defy.<br />
Be still as now, and a' my care shall be,<br />
How to contrive what pleasant is for thee.</td>

Rejoice thro' life, and all your fears beguile.<br />

'Till grown unfit for action, past their prime,<br />

As scrimp of manners, as of sense and grace;<br />
Oppressing all as punishment of their sin,<br />
That are within his tenth degree of kin:<br />
Rins in ilk trader's debt, wha's sae unjust<br />
To his ain fam'ly, as to give him trust.<br />

<i>Sir Will.</i> Such useless branches of a common-wealth,<br />
Should be lopt off, to give a state mair health.<br />
Unworthy bare reflection.&mdash;Symon, run<br />
O'er all your observations on my son;<br />
A parent's fondness easily finds excuse:<br />
But do not with indulgence truth abuse.<br />

<i>Sym.</i> To speak his praise, the langest simmer day<br />
Wad be o'er short,&mdash;cou'd I them right display.<br />
In word and deed he can sae well behave,<br />
That out of sight he runs before the lave;<br />
And when there's e'er a quarrel or contest,<br />
Patrick's made judge to tell whase cause is best;<br />
And his decreet stands good;&mdash;he'll gar it stand:<br />
Wha dares to grumble, finds his correcting hand;<br />
With a firm look, and a commanding way,<br />
He gars the proudest of our herds obey.<br />

<br />
<i>Sym.</i> Baith wonder well; for, troth, I didna spare<br />

Tho' some give light, some blindly lead the blind.<br />

He buys some books of history, sangs or sport:<br />
Nor does he want of them a rowth at will,<br />
And carries ay a poutchfu' to the hill.<br />
About ane Shakspear, and a famous Ben,<br />
He aften speaks, and ca's them best of men.<br />
How sweetly Hawthrenden and Stirling sing, }<br />
And ane ca'd Cowley, loyal to his king, }<br />
He kens fu' well, and gars their verses ring. }<br />
I sometimes thought he made o'er great a frase,<br />
About fine poems, histories and plays.<br />
When I reprov'd him anes,&mdash;a book he brings,<br />
With this, quoth he, on braes I crack with kings.<br />
<br />
<i>Sir Will.</i> He answer'd well; and much ye glad my ear,<br />
When such accounts I of my shepherd hear.<br />
Reading such books can raise a peasant's mind<br />
Above a lord's that is not thus inclin'd.<br />

Except on rainy Sundays, on a book;<br />
When we a leaf or twa haff read haff spell,<br />
'Till a' the rest sleep round as well's our sell?<br />

<i>Sir Will.</i> Well jested, Symon:&mdash;But one question more<br />
I'll only ask ye now, and then give o'er.<br />
The youth's arriv'd the age when little loves<br />
Flighter around young hearts like cooing doves:<br />

With Glaud's fair Neice, than I thought right or meet:<br />

When higher views shall greater thoughts inspire.<br />
Go, Symon, bring him quickly here to me;<br />
None but your self shall our first meeting see.<br />

<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Page 5, line 11 from top; the reading in the text
is:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center medium">"She fled as frae a shellycoat or kow."<br /></p>

<p class="center medium">This is the reading in the 8vo and 4to editions of 1721; (and
also in the 12mo edition of 1761;) where was published the
<i>first scene</i> of the Pastoral, as a separate poem, under the title
of "Patie and Roger." But, in all the editions of the <i>Gentle
Shepherd</i> that we have seen, the reading stands thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center medium">
"She fled as frae a shellycoated kow."<br />
</p>

<p class="center medium">We think the first reading is the true one; and that the
second is, probably, a typographical error. We have come
to this conclusion after an inquiry into the meaning of the
words "Shellycoat" and "Kow." The definitions of these
words, from the best authorities we know of, are subjoined;
which will enable such of our readers as have any curiosity in
the matter to judge for themselves.</p>

<p class="center medium">"<i>Shellycoat</i>, a spirit, who resides in the waters, and has
given his name to many a rock and stone upon the Scottish
coast, belongs also to the class of bogles. When he appeared,
he seemed to be decked with marine productions, and in particular
with <i>shells</i>, whose clattering announced his approach.
From this circumstance he derived his name.&mdash;<i>Shellycoat</i> must
not be confounded with <i>Kelpy</i>, a water spirit also, but of a
much more powerful and malignant nature."</p>

<p class="right medium">[<i>Scott's Minstrelsy</i>, vol. i., Introd. civ. cv.<br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p class="medium">"<i>Shellycoat.</i> One of those frightful spectres the ignorant
people are terrified at, and tell us strange stories of; that they
are clothed with a coat of shells, which make a horrid rattling;
that they'll be sure to destroy one, if he gets not a running
water between him and it: it dares not meddle with a woman
with child, &amp;c."</p>

<p class="right medium">
[<i>Ramsay's Poems.</i> vol. i., 4to edition, 1721.<br />
</p>

<p class="medium">"<i>Kow</i>or <i>Cow</i>" a hobgoblin; also, a scarecrow, a bugbear.
<i>Cow-man</i>, the devil."</p>

<p class="right medium">
[<i>Jamieson's Scottish Dictionary.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="medium">"<i>Wirrikow</i>," the devil.</p>

<p class="right medium">
[<i>Hogg's Mountain Bard.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="medium">The above definitions of <i>Shellycoat.</i>are very precise: that
of <i>Kow</i>is less so. Both are spirits, and frightful in character;
yet apparently of distinct habits. Hence the <i>first</i>of the readings
given above,&mdash;the oldest and that adopted in the text&mdash;</p>

<p class="center medium">
"She fled as frae a shellycoat or kow,"<br />
</p>

<p class="medium">is quite natural and proper: the <i>second</i> (though susceptible of
explanation,) seems much less so.</p></blockquote>

the present edition, is found in nearly all the more
modern editions: it is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="medium">In "Ramsay's Poems," published in London, by Millar,
Rivington &amp; Co., 2 vols. 12mo, 1761; (three years after
the author's death;) there occur several variations from the
text of the present edition. As the more important of these
changes, with one exception, have been adopted in the edition
edited by George Chalmers, published by Cadell &amp; Co., London,
2 vols. 8vo, 1800; (usually considered the "best edition" of
Ramsay's collected works;) and as they have been again
adopted in the recent reprint of Cadell's edition by Fullarton
&amp; Co., London, 3 vols. 12mo, 1850, it has been thought best
to present them here in the form of notes. The following,
therefore, are to be understood as the readings in the editions
just referred to:&mdash;</p></blockquote>

author rejected the above reading, and substituted that given
in the text. This would seem to be conclusive; and produces
a considerable degree of suspicion as to the authority for the
other alterations which we find in the editions of 1761 and

changes, it having been partially corrected, probably from the
8vo edition of 1808. These verbal changes are rarely, if ever,
improvements; frequently of little consequence, and sometimes
they appear silly; for instance, towards the end of the Pastoral
there is substituted, in two or three instances, Archbald instead
of Bauldy! We have not, therefore, thought it worth while to
note them here. We rather think that our readers, generally,
will not consider the readings above given, as improvements on

but I was told that it was printed and engraved for subscribers only."

one in 3 parts or volumes, 9th edition, London, 1733; the other in 4
volumes, 11th edition, London, 1750. Near the end of the second
volume this notice occurs in both editions:&mdash;
<br />
<br />
"The following SONGS to be sung in their proper Places on the
acting of the <i>Gentle Shepherd</i>, at each the page marked where they
come in."
<br />
<br />
Then follow the first twenty songs; (Song XXI., which concludes
the Pastoral, not being noticed;) at the head of each it is stated
by whom sung, and the page where it "comes in" is given. It would
seem, therefore, that the songs were mainly intended for "<i>the acting</i>;"
and that many copies of the Pastoral were extant without the songs,
to the pages of which these references in the "Miscellany" thus
formed an index or guide.</p>

Rome. He was the projector and founder of the Select Society of
Edinburgh in 1754. In 1767 he was appointed portrait painter to his
Majesty. On his return from Italy he died at Dover, on the 10th of
August, 1784, leaving a fortune of £40,000. He was twice married,
first to Miss Bayne, daughter of Professor Bayne of Edinburgh, and
sister of the late gallant Capt. Bayne of the Navy. She brought him one
daughter, who died young. His second wife was the eldest daughter of
Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelich, Baronet, by Emilia, daughter of the
Viscount of Stormont, and niece to the great Earl of Mansfield; she was
also the sister of the late Sir David and Sir John Lindsay. She died in
1782, and left by Allan Ramsay two daughters and a son. One of his
daughters was married to the late General Sir Archibald Campbell,
K. B. of Inverneil in Argyleshire, and the other to Colonel Malcolm.
His son, John Ramsay, has attained the rank of Lieutenant-General in
the army.
<br />
<br />
Of our Poet's daughters only two survived him; Christian, who died
about the year 1800, and Janet, who died in New-street, Canongate,
Edinburgh, on the 14th of January, 1804.</p>

published, and about the time of the publication of his second volume
in quarto, the 'Beggar's Opera' made its appearance, with such success
that it soon produced a great number of other pieces upon the
same musical plan. Amongst the rest, Ramsay, who had always been
a great admirer of Gay, especially for his ballads, was so far carried
away by the current as to print a new edition of his pastoral, interspersed
with songs adapted to the common Scotch tunes, He did not
reflect at the time that the 'Beggar's Opera' was only meant as a piece
of ironical satire; whereas his 'Gentle Shepherd' was a simple imitation
of nature, and neither a mimickry nor mockery of any other performance.
He was soon, however, sensible of his error, and would
have been glad to have retracted those songs; but it was too late; the
public was already in possession of them, and as the number of singers
is always greater than that of sound critics, the many editions since
printed of that pastoral have been almost uniformly in this vitiated
taste. He comforted himself, however, with the thought that the
contagion had not infected his second volume in quarto, where the
'Gentle Shepherd' is still to be found in its original purity."

and the estate of New Hall in the parish of Pennycuik, was to a

since farther confirmed, in a dissertation<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> from the elegant pen of
Sir David Rae, Lord Justice-Clerk; a descendant of Sir David Forbes,
proprietor of New Hall, and contemporary of Ramsay. Even without
such respectable evidence, however, we would inevitably be led
to the same conclusion, by the poet's well known acquaintance with
the natural beauties of the landscape at New Hall, where he was a
constant and welcome visitor; and because within the boundaries of
that fine estate, there is actually to be found all the peculiar scenery,
so graphically and beautifully described in the drama."

<p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> I am convinced, however, from a comparison of many of Ramsay's

that Ramsay had made frequent use of the latter for the explanation
of the most antiquated words; though he does not seem to have studied
it with that care, which his duty as an editor of ancient Scotish poetry
certainly required. In proof of this, his obligations to Ruddiman's
Glossary, the reader has only to compare, with the interpretations in
that work, the following, given by Ramsay in the Glossary to his

<p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> A learned writer has published, in the Transactions of the Society
of Scotish Antiquaries, a Dissertation on the Scoto-Saxon Dialect; of
which, as the work is not in every body's hands, the reader may not be
displeased with a short account. The author maintains this proposition;
that the Scoto-Saxon dialect was, at the time of the union of
the two nations, equal in every respect, and in some respects superior,
to the Anglo-Saxon dialect. He lays it down as a principle, that three
things constitute the perfection, or rather the relative superiority, of a
language: richness, energy, and harmony. He observes, that a language
is rich in proportion to the copiousness of its vocabulary, which
will principally depend, 1. on the number of its primitive or radical
words; 2. on the multiplicity of its derivations and compounds; and,
3. on the variety of its inflections. In all, or almost all of these respects,
he shows the superiority of the Scotish dialect of the Saxon to
the English. The Scots have all the English primitives, and many
hundreds besides. The Scots have derivatives from diminution, which
the English entirely want: e. g. <i>hat</i>, <i>hatty</i>, <i>hattiky</i>; <i>lass</i>, <i>lassie</i>, <i>lassiky</i>.
The degrees of diminution are almost unlimited: <i>wife</i>, <i>wifie</i>, <i>wifiky</i>,
<i>wee wifiky</i>, <i>wee wee wifiky</i>, &amp;c. Both the English, and Scots, dialects
are poor in the inflections; but the Glossary to Douglas's Virgil will
shew that the Scotish inflections are both more various, and less anomalous,
than the English. Energy is the boast both of the English,
and the Scotish, dialects; but, in this author's opinion, the Scotish
poetry can furnish some compositions of far superior energy to any
cotemporary English production. With respect to harmony, he gives
his suffrage likewise in favour of the Scotish dialect. He observes,
that the <i>sh</i> rarely occurs; its place being supplied by the simple <i>s</i>, as
in <i>polis</i>, <i>punis</i>, <i>sal</i>, &amp;c. The <i>s</i> itself is often supplied by the liquids <i>m</i>
or <i>n</i>; as in <i>expreme</i>, <i>depreme</i>; <i>compone</i>, <i>depone</i>. Harsh combinations
of consonants are avoided: as in using <i>sel</i>, <i>twal</i>, <i>neglek</i>, <i>temp</i>, <i>stown</i> or
<i>stawn</i>, for <i>self</i>, <i>twelve</i>, <i>neglect</i>, <i>tempt</i>, <i>stolen</i>. Even the vowel sounds
are, in this author's opinion, more harmonious, in the Scots, than in
the English, dialect; as the open <i>a</i>, and the proper Italic sound of <i>i</i>.
For further elucidation of this curious subject, the Dissertation itself
must be referred to, which will abundantly gratify the critical reader.
It is proper here to observe, that the remarks of this writer are the
more worthy of attention, that he is himself an excellent Scotish poet,
as the compositions subjoined to his Dissertation clearly evince. <i>Three

pastoral, which is generally a tame imitation of the dialogue of Virgil
and. Theocritus, that in the whole of the Scotish poem there are (I
think) only <i>three</i> passages that bring to mind those common-places
which, in the eclogues of Pope, we find almost in every line:
<br />
<br />
<span class="i2">The bees shall loath the flower, and quit the hive,</span><br />

Johnson, and Boswell, offered their homage; whose powers of
pleasing continued so resplendent as to charm the fastidious sage
into a declaration that, in visiting such a woman, he had spent his
day well. This celebrated patroness of poets was the accomplished
daughter of the noble house of Kennedy, who having married, in
1708, Alexander the Earl of Eglinton, by whom she had three sons,
two of whom succeeded to the earldom, and seven daughters who
married into honourable families, died on the 18th of March, 1780,
at the patriarchal age of ninety-one."&mdash;<i>Geo. Chalmers' Life of Ramsay,
